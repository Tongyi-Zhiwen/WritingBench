随着大数据时代的到来，云计算资源的调度问题[1]愈发突出，逐渐成为制约云服务性能提升的瓶颈。现有资源调度算法多依赖经验规则或静态策略，难以适应工作负载的动态变化与复杂性。因此，本文提出了基于机器学习[2]的ML-RSA算法，旨在通过智能化预测与动态调整，实现高效的资源调度与优化利用，以应对大数据环境带来的挑战。 1 大数据环境下的资源调度需求 大数据工作负载具有数据量大、任务复杂、处理时间长以及资源需求动态变化等特性，这对资源调度提出了更高要求。具体来说，大数据集需要大量的存储和计算资源、任务间的依赖关系增加了调度的复杂性、长时间运行的任务需要有效的管理、资源需求的动态变化要求调度系统能够实时响应。因此，大数据环境下的资源调度算法必须能处理海量数据，考虑任务依赖关系，保证长时间任务的稳定运行，并能动态调整资源，以适应实时变化的工作负载。这些需求促进了资源调度算法向更智能化和动态化的方向发展。 2 基于机器学习的资源调度算法 2.1 算法整体设计 ML-RSA算法专注于提高大数据环境下云计算资源的调度效率，并通过智能化和动态化的手段实现。设计分为四个步骤：使用机器学习模型分析历史数据，以预测未来的资源需求；根据预测和当前资源状况，采用贪心策略[3]进行任务分配；在任务执行中不断收集监控数据，并据此动态调整资源分配，确保任务的高效、稳定运行；考虑任务间的依赖关系、优先级和节点性能差异，以实现精确的资源调度。设计流程如图1所示。 图1 资源调度算法（ML-RSA）模型设计流程  2.2 未来资源需求使用的机器学习模型预测 准确预测未来资源需求是ML-RSA算法的关键。该算法采用了多种机器学习模型，如利用回归树[4]、随机森林和深度学习网络[5]来分析历史资源使用数据和工作负载特征。这些模型能够学习数据中的复杂模式，预测不同类型任务在不同时间段对计算、存储和网络资源的需求。以下是模型的概述以及相应的数学公式和实验数据的描述。 (1）回归树通过递归地分割数据集来构建树结构，每个节点代表一个决策规则，叶子节点代表预测值。对于连续变量，常用的分割标准是最小化平方误差。 (2）随机森林是由多个决策树组成的集成模型。每个树在训练时，都会使用随机的数据集和特征子集。最终的预测结果是所有树预测结果的平均值，其平均值的计算方法如公式（1）所示：  其中，是单个树的预测结果，是树的总数。 (3）深度学习网络，如神经网络，通过多层神经元来学习数据的复杂模式。每层神经元的输出是下一层神经元的输入，通过激活函数进行转换。神经元的输出如公式（2）所示：  其中，是权重矩阵，是输入项，是偏置项，是激活函数。 为了展示深度学习网络在预测不同时间段的网络带宽需求方面的应用，本研究进行了实验并收集了数据，具体如表1所示。 表1 深度学习网络模型实验数据  数据分析揭示了网络带宽需求会随着历史网络使用量、任务类型和当前系统负载的不同而变化。这种类型的数据适合采用深度学习网络来建模，因为深度学习网络可以捕捉到这些变量之间的复杂关系。 交叉验证和模型融合技术提高了预测的准确性和鲁棒性，预测结果将作为资源调度的依据，帮助系统提前做好准备，避免资源短缺或浪费。本研究针对未来资源需求预测的部分，创建了一个ML-RSA算法模型，如图2所示。 图2 针对未来资源需求预测的ML-RSA算法模型  2.3贪心策略在任务分配上的应用 ML-RSA算法在任务分配时采用了贪心策略，以优化资源使用。它依据当前的资源状况和任务需求，为那些能最高效利用资源的任务进行了分配。文章介绍了一个效用函数来评估任务对计算、存储和网络资源的利用，通过选择效用值最高的任务进行资源分配，直到资源用尽。这种方法决策迅速，通常能得到接近最佳的结果。 假设任务的资源需求和系统资源状态可以由以下参数详细描述。：任务的计算资源需求（CPU）；：任务的存储资源需求（内存/磁盘）；：任务的网络资源需求（带宽）；：任务的预计执行时间；：任务的截止时间紧迫性；：任务的资源历史使用率。可以定义效用函数，如公式（3）所示：  其中，、、分别是系统可提供的最大计算、存储和网络资源；α和β是调整任务执行时间和截止时间紧迫性的权重因子；是调节资源历史使用率影响的资源调度策略的权重因子；表示任务执行时间的倒数，鼓励优先调度执行时间短的任务；表示任务的相对截止时间紧迫性，鼓励优先调度截止时间接近的任务；是一个衰减因子，用于减少过度使用资源的任务的优先级。 在每次资源分配决策时，算法评估所有待分配任务的效用函数，并选择具有最大值的任务进行资源分配。 2.4 实时监控数据的调整策略 为了应对工作负载的动态变化，ML-RSA算法引入了实时监控数据的调整策略。系统通过收集实时监控数据，如任务执行情况、资源使用率和系统健康状态等信息，来感知环境的变化。当检测到资源不足或过剩时，算法将动态调整资源分配，如迁移部分任务到其他节点或添加额外的资源。这种反馈机制使得ML-RSA算法能够及时响应突发事件，保持系统的稳定运行。实时监控数据也被用于更新机器学习模型，以提高未来预测的准确性。 3 实验分析 3.1 实验一：任务完成效率 实验设置：（1）环境，使用包含30个计算节点的集群，每个节点配置为双路Xeon Gold 5120 CPU、128 GB RAM和2 TB SSD RAID;(2）工作负载，生成包含数据挖掘、机器学习训练和在线事务处理的组合任务。 实施步骤：（1）所有任务同时提交给系统，确保资源需求超出集群总供给，模拟高竞争环境；（2）记录每种算法下的任务执行时间以及从任务提交到完成的时间。具体实验数据如表2所示。 表2 任务完成率实验数据  实验结果表明，ML-RSA算法的任务响应时间和平均等待时间均优于传统算法。ML-RSA算法在处理任务调度时更为迅速和高效，尤其是在资源紧张的环境下；ML-RSA算法的平均任务完成时间比传统算法短，这意味着在完成同样数量和类型的任务时，ML-RSA算法能够更快地完成，从而提高整体效率。 3.2 实验二：资源利用率 实验设置：（1）监控工具，使用Prometheus和Grafana实时监控系统资源利用率；（2）度量标准，包括CPU使用率、内存使用率和I/O操作。 实施步骤：（1）在实验过程中，持续监控每种资源的使用情况；（2）分析各算法下的资源峰值利用率和平均利用率。具体实验数据如表3所示。 表3 资源利用率实验数据  实验结果表明，ML-RSA算法的CPU峰值和平均利用率均高于传统算法，显示其能更有效地利用CPU资源；ML-RSA算法同样在内存利用率上显示出优势，其峰值和平均利用率均高于传统算法，表明其更能有效地利用可用内存；ML-RSA算法的I/O操作峰值和平均值也均高于传统算法，说明在数据处理和任务执行中，ML-RSA算法能更高效地进行I/O操作。 3.3 实验三：系统适应性和稳定性测试 实验设置：（1）动态变化，在实验过程中随机注入额外的大规模任务，模拟突发负载；（2）度量标准，系统对突发负载的响应时间，以及恢复稳定状态的时间。 实施步骤：（1）在实验进行到特定时间点时，注入高资源需求的任务；（2）测量系统恢复到正常资源利用率所需的时间。图3比较了ML-RSA算法与传统资源调度算法在“系统适应性和稳定性测试”方面的关键性能指标。 图3 系统适应性和稳定性测试结果  实验结果表明，ML-RSA算法的响应时间和恢复到稳定状态的时间均显著优于传统算法。ML-RSA算法能够更快地适应系统市场变化和突发负载，快速从资源紧张状态中恢复；ML-RSA算法显示出在高负载情况下保持系统稳定性的能力，这主要归功于其动态资源调整策略，能够根据实时需求优化资源分配。 4 结语 在分析ML-RSA算法的实验结果后，可知该算法通过改善资源分配和实时调整，显著提高了任务处理速度和资源效率。具体而言，在高竞争环境中，ML-RSA算法比传统算法快，且提高了CPU和内存的使用率。此外，ML-RSA算法适应性和稳定性更强，能有效应对突发负载并快速恢复平衡。未来，研究将着重于提升算法的可扩展性和弹性，并优化其能源效率以支持环保计算。同时，探索其在处理不同类型资源及跨域资源共享方面的潜力，以进一步提高资源调度的整体效能。,为这篇云计算资源调度算法的学术论文撰写摘要（800-1000字）",

{"index": 13, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Abstract", "query": "请为一篇探讨区块链技术在供应链中应用的学术论文撰写中文摘要，论文其他部分如下:一、引言 自2008年中本聪在比特币论坛上发表名为“Bitcoin:A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”[1]的论文以来，区块链的概念随着比特币的火爆受到了各国政府和学者的高度关注。各个国家相继推出涉及区块链技术的系列政策文件，加速区块链的应用落地，使其成为引领新一代信息技术的主角。我国早在2016年就发表了首份《中国区块链技术和应用发展白皮书》。《白皮书》详细介绍了区块链在国内外的发展现状、应用场景与未来发展方向[2]。同年，国务院印发的《“十三五”国家信息化规划》中明确将区块链技术列为战略性前沿技术[3]。2019年10月24日，习近平总书记在中央政治局第十八次集体学习时强调，“把区块链作为核心技术自主创新重要突破口，加快推动区块链技术和产业创新发展”[4]，进一步凸显了区块链的重要作用。 区块链技术给各行各业带来了新的发展机遇，其应用逐渐从金融领域扩展到其他领域，供应链就是其中之一。随着区块链技术的不断发展，传统的供应链管理模式亟须在融入新技术的基础上进行全新的变革。因此，科学地梳理并总结“区块链+供应链”领域的研究热点与前沿趋势，具有重要的理论和实践意义。本文以Cite Space文献计量分析为指引，对区块链技术在供应链中的应用研究进行述评，通过梳理现有文献，在明晰区块链技术给供应链带来的深刻变革及应用现状的基础上，对未来研究方向进行展望。 二、区块链技术在供应链中的应用研究文献计量分析 为全面了解区块链技术在供应链中的应用研究现状，借助Cite Space可视化分析软件进行文献共被引分析、关键词共现分析、关键词聚类分析[5]。以“blockchain”和“supply chain”为检索主题词在Web of Science数据库中进行文献检索，语种设定为英语，文献类型选择“Article”或“Review”，检索时间为2020年12月，时间跨度设为2008—2020，共检索到英文文献455篇。 通过文献共被引分析，发现有一些对区块链技术在供应链中的应用研究影响较大的文献。如Swan[6]在2015年出版了著作Blockchain:Blueprint for a New Economy，讨论了比特币和区块链技术的三个不同阶段:区块链1.0、区块链2.0和区块链3.0，并提出区块链3.0在货币、金融、科技、基因组学、健康、学习、学术出版、开发、救援和文化等领域的诸多应用前景，为后续研究奠定了基础。Kshetri[7]在2018年发表了论文“Blockchain's Roles in Meeting Key Supply Chain Management Objectives”，以马士基、阿里巴巴、沃尔玛等11家成功运用区块链的代表性企业为例，研究了区块链对关键供应链管理目标，如成本、质量、速度、可靠性、风险降低、可持续性和灵活性的影响，指出了区块链在食品供应链、国际物流、网络安全等诸多领域的应用。Saberi et al.[8]在2019年发表的论文“Blockchain Technology and Its Relationships to Sustainable Supply Chain Management”系统介绍了区块链在供应链管理中的应用，并从经济、社会和环境三个维度阐释了区块链在可持续供应链网络中的优势;基于对文献的回顾，将区块链技术应用面临的障碍分为四个方面:组织间、组织内、技术和外部障碍;最后提出了未来的研究方向以有效解决区块链的技术障碍，使区块链更好地应用到供应链管理中。这些文献引领了区块链在供应链领域的应用研究，并使相关研究得以不断深化。 关键词共现分析显示(如表1所示)，区块链技术在供应链中的应用主题较多，从区块链、供应链、智能合约到食品供应链、供应链绩效、影响、挑战、可持续性等。进一步通过关键词聚类分析(如表2所示)发现，研究的热点主题主要涉及区块链技术、区块链技术在供应链中的应用领域、对供应链的影响、未来挑战等方面。基于此，下面将围绕以下五个方面问题对现有文献进行述评:(1)什么是区块链技术?(2)为什么要在供应链中融入区块链技术?(3)区块链技术主要应用在供应链的哪些领域?(4)这些应用给供应链带来什么影响?(5)未来面临哪些挑战? 表1 关键词共现分析  表2 关键词聚类结果  三、区块链技术在供应链中的应用研究主题现状述评 (一)区块链技术:概念、作用与类型 区块链最初作为一种支持加密货币领域交易的技术而出现[1]。Christidis and Devetsiokiotis[9]将区块链定义为“在网络成员之间复制和共享的分布式数据结构”。Al-Saqaf and Seidler[10]则将区块链定义为“分布式数字分类账或会计账簿”。在此基础上，Risius and Spohrer[11]对区块链技术给出了一个较正式的定义，即“区块链技术是指一种用于以加密方式捕获和存储网络参与者之间一致的、不变的、线性的事务日志的完全分布式系统。在功能上类似于分布式分类账，由网络内所有参与交易的各方一致保存、更新和验证。该技术加强了网络透明度，并确保最终在系统范围内就整个交易历史的有效性达成共识”。尽管给出了这个正式定义，但显然区块链还有一些其他特征，如去中心、去中介、防篡改等。国内学者王元地等[12]综述了有关区块链技术的内涵，将其分为五类:一是基于数据的视角将区块链定义为一种数据结构或数据库;二是基于记账的视角将区块链定义为一种分布式记账的底层技术;三是基于协议的视角将区块链定义为一种互联网协议;四是基于技术的视角将区块链定义为一种由多种技术构成的新技术方案;五是基于经济的视角将区块链定义为一种价值互联网络。从供应链视角来看，区块链技术可以理解为与交易的去中介化相关，即无须中介机构来验证交易并为交易提供可信度的技术[13]。 区块链技术主要解决交易的信任和安全问题，针对这个问题，主要有四项核心技术，包括分布式存储、非对称加密、共识机制、智能合约[14-17]。区块链技术具有去中心化、去信任、公开透明、开放性、防篡改、可追溯性、安全可靠等特点[18-19]。区块链技术的这些特性意味着其将对供应链管理诸如成员关系、协作、信任和基于角色的云敏捷性操作模型的变化等方面产生影响[13]。它能有效解决网络信息不对称，其最为核心的价值在于对网络中的每一个节点充分赋能，解决交易的信任机制和激励机制问题[20]。 根据读取区块链、向区块链提交交易并参与共识流程控制等方面的访问权限，可以将区块链区分为三种主要类型:公有链(public blockchain)、私有链(private blockchain)和联盟链(consortium blockchain)[19]。在公有链中，每个交易都是公开的，用户可以保持匿名。网络通常有一个激励机制来鼓励参与者加入网络。比特币和以太坊就是公有链的例子。在有权限许可的区块链中，参与者需要获得加入的邀请或许可，访问权限由成员联盟(联盟链)或单个组织(私有链)控制。供应链就是一种联盟链，成员通过授权后才能加入与退出网络。在联盟链上，供应链各参与方共享一个透明可靠的信息平台和追溯流程，同时，各参与方也可以基于区块链数据开展如供应链金融、精准营销等服务[21]。 (二)供应链应用区块链技术的驱动因素 关于为什么要在供应链中应用区块链技术，国外学者运用技术接受和采用理论以及行为理论，从绩效预期、社会影响、有利条件、对技术的信任、组织间的信任等方面分析了供应链采用区块链技术的驱动因素[22]，并对比分析了印度和美国情景下的差异[23]。供应链采用区块链技术的驱动因素如图1所示。 图1 供应链采用区块链技术的驱动因素  资料来源:笔者根据Francisco and Swanson (2018)[22]及Queiroz and Wamba (2018)[23]的相关文献整理。  首先，绩效预期是供应链应用区块链技术的最重要的驱动力。已有研究表明，个体采纳和使用技术的意愿在很大程度上取决于绩效预期[24-26]，而区块链技术应用对供应链从效率和产品质量到关键流程的改进方面都产生了很高的预期[7]。其次是社会影响因素。社会影响是指个体对其他人认为应该使用新技术的重要程度的认知[27]。区块链应用是一种“社会性”技术，如果随着规范性压力和用户“临界数量”的增加，进而实现网络效应的增加，这种情况下可能会导致更高的使用意愿[22]。因此供应链成员间现有关系对是否采用跨网络的区块链技术会产生重大影响。再次是便利条件因素。便利条件是指“个体认为组织技术基础设施赖以支持系统使用的程度”[27]。就区块链而言，就是指个体对组织中可用于支持区块链使用的资源的理解。已有研究表明，包括计算机、网速、与其他系统的集成等在内的便利条件都会影响相关技术的采纳和使用[28-30]。最后是信任因素，包括对技术的信任以及供应链利益相关者之间的信任。技术公信力会影响人们对技术的态度，进而影响人们使用技术的意愿。Thatcher et al.[31]指出，缺乏对IT的信任可能导致用户出于对可靠性或性能缺乏信心而停止使用该技术。如果用户意识到区块链技术不安全，他们将不会使用该技术。当然，随着用户对技术的了解和学习越多，他们拥有的经验和知识就越多，技术在他们看来就越可信。因此，对技术的信任成为了解用户使用意愿的一个重要因素。供应链利益相关者之间的信任是指供应链网络中两个或两个以上的成员之间相互依赖并维护彼此期望的意愿[23]。供应链利益相关者之间的信任是将区块链技术应用于供应链网络中的基本前提。 此外，还有学者从供应链管理目标角度分析应用区块链技术的驱动因素，比如克服供应链中断与复杂性[32-33]，确保产品的安全、真实、合法[34-35]，以及公共安全与反腐败[36-37]等。 (三)区块链在供应链中的主要应用领域 区块链技术起初主要应用于金融行业，之后逐渐拓展到农业、零售、医疗、制造业以及能源等多行业，国内外研究普遍认为物流和供应链领域是这项技术能够带来彻底变革的主要领域之一[38-42]。 首先，“区块链+供应链金融”是国内外研究的热门领域。区块链技术的运用能解决传统供应链金融中供应商信用信息记录不全、二级以上的供应商与经销商难获贷款、中小微企业难获授信、授信额度难以确认、融资后履约、清算滞后等问题[21]。区块链在提高供应链金融行业的透明度、扩大服务对象、提高效率、降低风险、加强资金流管理中具有明显优势[43]。区块链在国内供应链金融应用案例表现为以核心企业为主导的“Chained Finance”区块链金融平台、以技术提供方为主导的腾讯“区块链+供应链金融解决方案”、以金融机构为主导的平安银行供应链应收账款服务平台等三个主要类型[44]。在国外，金融科技公司OGYDocs构建区块链贸易金融平台Wave，利用分布式账本对文件和商品在运输过程中的所有权进行管理，替代传统的各项纸质单证，以提高国际贸易的交易效率和安全性，去除纠纷、伪造品和不必要的风险[44]。 其次，物流供应链领域是区块链最有应用前景的领域之一[45]。区块链技术的分布式记账特性能使供应链上的信息保持一致，各节点成员共享公开的信息资源，有利于解决信息不对称问题;智能合约机制可在无需第三方介入的情况下按规则自动生成合约，并在满足交易条件时自动执行合约条款，能提高各环节支付和交易效率，避免资金延迟风险;时间戳和溯源防伪技术可对物流供应链上的产品进行全链跟踪，实现安全、高效、可靠的信息传输;非对称加密技术可以保证数据不被篡改，有助于交易主题之间信任关系的建立[46]。在各国政府和相关企业的支持下，一些“区块链+物流供应链”项目得以实践，如丹麦航运公司马士基与IBM的全球跨境物流系统[47]、新加坡公司Yojee的运输优化系统[48]、瑞士公司Modum与苏黎世大学合作设计的医药运输系统[7]、英国公司Everledger基于区块链的产品来源验证系统[49]等。这些项目的成功实施为区块链应用积累了宝贵经验。 最后，区块链在其他领域供应链上的应用体现了区块链技术应用的多样性，具体表现为在农产品、食品、医药、电力、军事供应链等众多领域的具体运用。区块链在农产品[50]和食品[51]供应链上的应用有利于保障供应链上产品的安全和质量，从而给企业带来良好的品牌形象和信任;应用领域主要包括新鲜食品交付，食品、乳制品、农产品等的安全、透明与可追溯，食品监管与评价等[52-55]。区块链在医药供应链上的应用可以加强在全球贸易中检测假药的程序[56]，并提高药品在跨境运输中的效率[57];应用主要包括医疗设备和医药用品的供应、安全与监管，采购渠道透明化，构建健康物联网等[58-61]。区块链在制造业供应链应用研究包括产品溯源和召回、流程可视化、物流实时跟踪等[62-64]。区块链在电力供应链上的应用可解决电力供应链利益分配的问题[65]，推动智能电网[66-67]、分布式光伏[68]等电力能源系统的建设。区块链在军事供应链上的应用可提高军事供应链管理的智能化水平，保证军内需求侧与外部供给侧的互联互通，并促进军事供应链体系内各实体的价值互联[69]。关于区块链技术在不同行业供应链的应用，现有文献主要以案例研究为主，如表3所示。 表3 区块链技术在不同行业供应链的应用案例  关于区块链技术在供应链应用中的具体作用领域，学者们主要针对供应链六大“痛点”，即产品溯源、货物完整性与安全性、争议解决、供应链数字化、合规性、信任与利益相关者管理，探讨区块链技术提供的解决方案(如图2所示)。具体体现在:一是区块链技术的透明可视、可追溯性用于产品溯源，防止供应网络中的欺诈和假冒行为[70-72];二是时间戳用于确保供应链信息的不可篡改和完整性。时间戳能够对数据产生的时间进行认证，从而验证这段数据在产生后是否经过篡改[36]。区块链中的数据可以包括所有权(按时间顺序排列的所有者列表)、位置数据(材料曾经所在的位置和现在的位置)、产品具体数据(产品的属性、性能、价格、质量、日期和状态)以及环境影响数据(能源消耗、二氧化碳排放等)，这大大增强了信息的完整性[73];三是基于智能合约的自动控制用于确保供应链交易在合适条件下自动履约，避免了过去履约过程中的争议，同时实现将多个智能仓储和制造系统无缝集成到一体化流程中的目标[74];四是区块链与人工智能、工作流自动化及物联网一起成为供应链数字化的支柱，它能从根本上减少交易时间和管理成本，并通过用防篡改的数字格式的自动数据存储过程取代冗长的纸面记录加快货物流通[75]，促进业务交易流程自动化;五是区块链技术使供应链做到实时可视化，确保满足所有合同条件，并迫使组织在合规性要求范围内进行协作，同时存储的数据随时可供审核验证[76];六是区块链通过提供不可逆、不可篡改和不可损坏的记录，采用问责制和嵌入式安全机制为供应链提供可信的交易基础设施，使去中心化的协作成为可能[64]。 图2 供应链“痛点”及对应的区块链技术能力  资料来源:笔者根据Chang et al.(2020)的相关文献[77]整理。  (四)区块链应用给供应链带来的影响 关于区块链应用给供应链带来的影响，学者们的观点不太一致，正面和负面影响兼有。其中，关于区块链带来的正面影响，学者们认为主要体现在五个方面:一是区块链技术透明、去中介化特征减少了供应链中潜在的机会主义行为[78];二是区块链技术提高了供应链数据的可得性、不可篡改性，增强了供应链端到端的可视性和可追溯性[79];三是区块链各个节点的信息完全一致，可削弱供应链的“牛鞭效应”[80];四是通过自动化和降低供应链结构复杂性来提高效率，减少重复检测成本，促进供应链协同与治理[81];五是推动供应链结构重组和模式创新、增强从供应链伙伴中获得关系租金的潜力[82]。研究表明，区块链技术能在成本、质量、速度、可靠性、风险降低、灵活性和可持续性等供应链关键目标实现上发挥重要作用[7]。运用区块链技术的透明性、可追溯性、可扩展性、改善数据安全性和去中心化等优势，能最大程度地降低供应链中的交易成本，减少机会主义行为并提高交易的透明度，从而提高供应链绩效[83-84]。 一些研究认为，区块链在供应链中的应用也存在负面影响，主要表现在以下四个方面:一是出现控制捆绑。由于核心企业构建的私有链或联盟链的集中度高，随着时间推移会出现捆绑和垄断，导致等级增强和权力集中[85]。二是导致供应链隔离。区块链技术应用可能会迫使供应链企业思考哪些类型的信息和知识不宜透明，从而采取降低信息泄露风险的措施，以保持自身竞争优势[86];而核心企业在构建区块链时也可能会考虑只邀请部分关系紧密的成员参加，这本身就产生了一种隔离效应，这种隔离效应也不能真正有利于供应链绩效效率的提升[82]。三是隐私安全。虽然区块链增加了透明度，但完全透明带来隐私安全风险，比如消费者个人信息可能会泄露[87]。四是基于区块链技术的供应链适应性降低、可延展性低、难以修改这些特点使现有的架构难以跟进[88-89]。 (五)供应链应用区块链技术面临的挑战 主要体现在三个方面。一是区块链技术本身面临的挑战。主要体现在性能、安全性、隐私保护等方面。在性能方面，分布式记账的存储方式使得区块链上的每个节点都要完整地记录所有数据，这会导致链上每个节点的存储容量急速膨胀[90]，加上区块的大小与带宽、网络延迟等因素的影响，容易造成业务吞吐量低、资源浪费、可用性差等一系列问题[91]，难以大规模运用到供应链管理中。在安全性方面，随着计算机算力的提升和新的数学算法的出现，区块链加密技术可能面临被破解的风险[92];同时，区块链在网络层可能受“女巫攻击”，在共识层可能受“51%算力攻击”，在智能合约层由于代码的漏洞易受“黑客攻击”，从而可能带来巨大损失[93]。在隐私保护方面，为保证区块链上的数据具备可追溯性、可验证性等特征，链上所有节点都记录着区块链系统中全部数据，这一特性可能导致恶意攻击者直接从区块链账本中获取记录的数据，通过分析数据窥探用户隐私。攻击者还可能通过点对点网络通信的特征，在链中部署节点，监听网络中各节点隐私信息以及网络通信信息，甚至对正常节点发起攻击[94]。因此，技术的不成熟和内部构架的固有局限是首先要考虑到的。此外，还面临如何保证数据来源的真实性问题[64]，这需要解决区块链之间的互操作性以及与其他技术的融合。 二是个体与组织面临的挑战。对于组织来说，出于自身利益保护，加之多系统之间兼容难，链上的一些主体可能会对区块链技术应用加以抵制[33];一些组织对区块链带来的完全透明化存在顾虑，也不愿分享有价值的信息[19];一些中小企业由于技术和资金问题会影响其参与度。对于个体来说，区块链技术的复杂性也使个体用户难以对其完全理解、接受和信任。此外，由于区块链需要高水平的能源消耗来维持网络[95]，从而引发人们对能源消耗的关注。 三是监管层面的挑战。供应链去中介化可能会给有关各方造成不确定性，特别是在交易的自动执行形式和交易监督方面，需要确立相关标准以确保智能合约的合法性和可执行性[87]。 四、未来研究展望 区块链技术在供应链中的应用得到了越来越多的关注，但区块链技术应用尚处于初始阶段[19]，无论是区块链技术本身还是其在供应链中的应用研究尚待进一步深入。 (一)区块链底层技术研究 区块链底层技术研究主要针对区块链技术在供应链中运用的技术局限性探讨未来改进方向。区块链技术目前存在的业务吞吐量低、网络延迟、存储资源冗余及隐私安全等方面的技术问题成为其在供应链领域应用的技术瓶颈[33]。关于吞吐量和延迟问题，尽管已有研究者提出实施比特币-NG算法和增加每个区块的大小来解决[96]，但这两种方法均会增加节点的运行成本。未来的研究应注重在不产生副作用的情况下选择合适的算法及区块大小来解决这一问题。关于区块链的存储容量问题，现有研究已提出了一些解决方案，如将原始数据存储在链外，而链上仅存储元数据、小型关键数据和原始数据的哈希值;构建具有不同用途的多层区块链体系结构;开发涉及深度学习概念的新算法等[97]。未来研究应将深度学习或人工智能与当前算法相集成，以提高计算的效率并消除区块链中冗余的数据。在隐私保护方面，现有研究主要从隐身地址、Pedersen承诺、环签名、动态加密、零知识证明等公共区块链架构角度来解决隐私泄露问题[98]，未来研究应更多聚焦于从双重区块链架构的角度来提高隐私安全。此外，研究供应链应用区块链的安全问题，需开展与其他技术的融合问题研究，如与人工智能、大数据分析技术、物联网技术等进行融合。由于不同产业对技术的需求不一样，还需要研究区块链技术的应用与相关产业需求的匹配问题。 (二)中国情境下区块链在供应链中的应用实证研究 现有关于区块链在供应链中的应用实证研究，结合中国情境的研究成果还很缺乏，未来将探讨中国情境下区块链技术在不同行业供应链和不同供应链场景上的进一步应用。包括:实证研究中国情境下供应链企业应用区块链技术的影响因素;研究区块链在供应链中应用的实施框架，探讨区块链在不同类型供应链中应用的最佳实践，对区块链在特定行业内或跨行业应用进行比较研究，分析不同场景中区块链应用面临的问题及对策，以及将区块链应用于供应链的组织能力研究;深入探讨在供应链中应用智能合约对交易成本的影响以及对克服供应链中断的作用，研究不同供应链环境下各种智能合约应用对合同管理、长期供应商关系和服务水平协议的影响;开展业务流程重组研究，侧重于区块链对流程简化的影响，以实现更精简的多伙伴流程等。 (三)基于区块链技术的供应链治理研究 现有研究指出，区块链技术应用给供应链治理带来了新的挑战[19]。由于区块链技术的去中心化特征，基于区块链的供应链结构及其运营与每个供应链参与主体都休戚相关，因此需要确定一套成员之间如何交互的规则。就参与主体而言，需要明确成员进入或退出区块链网络的方式、每个成员将扮演的角色类型以及解决成员之间潜在争端的方法。在数据方面，应重点关注可添加到区块链中的数据类型以及负责输入所需数据的人员。一旦数据进入区块链，还需要设置谁拥有这些数据以及如何处理IP权限。在交易方面，应建立负责验证交易的人员和所需的节点数。在智能合约情况下，由哪一方负责审核和批准以及代码如何捕获正确的业务逻辑都应有明确的角色和责任。由于智能合约具有法律效力，这使得区块链网络的治理更加复杂。因此，需要对区块链技术背景下供应链治理模式进行深入研究。 (四)区块链在供应链中的应用监管研究 目前针对区块链技术可能引发的风险，大多采用事后干预和再调整的措施，无法应对风险隐匿性强、传染性强、扩散速度快的金融风险，亟须形成整体化、系统化的监管体系来降低风险带来的损失。如:应设立相应的监管制度和技术使用规范，建立风险防范治理机制，以实现事前监管;需建立柔性监管体系，引入监管科技，在提升监管有效性的同时提升效率，促进和支持合法合规的创新;还需通过“授权型立法”模式的建立、企业沙箱准入门槛的制定以及沙箱退出机制的建立形成我国沙箱监管框架，建构起以“中国式沙箱监管”为核心的区块链金融风险监管机制。总的来说，目前对区块链的监管研究还处于探索阶段，未来应更加注重构建适应供应链金融模式的监管体系。",

The Key Role of Load Forecasting and Dispatch Optimization in Smart Grids  \nAs the next-generation power system, the smart grid integrates advanced sensing, communication, control, and information technologies, characterized by efficiency, reliability, economy, cleanliness, and safety. During the operation of the smart grid, accurate load forecasting and optimized dispatching play a crucial role. Load forecasting provides fundamental data for grid operation. By predicting electricity load over a future period, grid dispatching can prepare for power balance and peak-shaving in advance, reasonably arrange the operation of generators and transmission lines, and improve the grid’s economy and reliability. For example, by forecasting the load of key power-consuming areas such as industrial parks and commercial centers, the topology and equipment configuration of the distribution network can be optimized, reducing line loss and investment costs. Additionally, load forecasting provides the basis for demand-side management. By analyzing and guiding user electricity consumption behavior, optimal allocation and efficient use of electrical resources can be achieved. Optimized dispatching, based on load forecasting, comprehensively considers factors such as generation costs, transmission constraints, and power market rules to formulate the optimal power dispatch strategy, ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system and its economic and efficient operation. For instance, optimized dispatching can reasonably arrange the output of multiple energy sources such as hydropower, thermal power, wind power, and photovoltaic, maximizing the absorption of renewable energy, reducing fossil energy consumption, and minimizing environmental pollution. Moreover, optimized dispatching can also coordinate the interconnection of multiple regional grids, enabling cross-regional power transactions and mutual support, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and benefits of the power system. In conclusion, load forecasting and dispatch optimization are indispensable key technologies for smart grids, playing a significant role in ensuring the safe and stable operation of power systems, improving energy utilization efficiency, promoting renewable energy development, and enabling efficient operation of the power market.\n\n2. Construction of Smart Grid Load Forecasting Model Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology  \n2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing  \nThe construction of a smart grid load forecasting model begins with data collection and preprocessing. By deploying smart meters, sensors, and other devices at various nodes in the grid, multi-dimensional load data such as voltage, current, power, and frequency can be collected in real-time. Additionally, external factors that influence the load, such as weather conditions, economic indicators, and holidays, must be collected. To improve data quality, raw data needs to be cleaned, normalized, and feature-extracted. The cleaning process includes removing outliers and filling in missing values, which can be done using median filtering, Kalman filtering, and other algorithms. Normalization processing maps data with different dimensions to the same scale. Common methods include Min-Max normalization and Z-score normalization. Feature extraction involves mining key features that significantly impact load forecasting, such as periodicity, trends, and randomness of the load. Common feature extraction methods include wavelet transform, empirical mode decomposition, and singular value decomposition. It is important to balance the time granularity and spatial granularity of the data during preprocessing, selecting the appropriate time scale and regional partitioning. This needs to take into account both the accuracy requirements of the forecasting model and the complexity of computation and communication overhead. Moreover, data must be protected for privacy and security to prevent sensitive information leakage. After preprocessing, the data can be represented in the form of a time series, {x1, x2, ..., xt, ..., xn}, where xt represents the load value at the t-th moment, satisfying the following mathematical model:  \nIn the formula, f represents the nonlinear mapping function of load, p is the historical load backtracking period, θ is the parameter vector of the function, and εt is the noise term.\n\n2.2 Model Selection and Training  \nAfter obtaining high-quality load data, an appropriate artificial intelligence model must be selected for load forecasting. Common models include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). SVM classifies and predicts nonlinear separable data by finding the optimal decision hyperplane in high-dimensional space, with good generalization ability and robustness. RF constructs multiple decision trees and performs ensemble learning, effectively handling high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships, while also evaluating the importance of features. LSTM, as an improved recurrent neural network, captures long-term dependencies in load data through gating mechanisms and memory cells, providing superior performance in time series forecasting. During model selection, factors such as model complexity, computational efficiency, and interpretability need to be weighed, and the model’s generalization performance should be assessed using methods like cross-validation. Once the model is selected, parameter tuning and training optimization are required. Taking SVM as an example, the objective function can be represented as:  \nObjective function:  \nConstraints:  \nIn the formula, ω is the weight vector, b is the bias term, ξi is the slack variable, C is the penalty factor, φ(xi) is the kernel function mapping, and yi is the sample label. By solving this convex quadratic programming problem, the optimal model parameters of SVM can be obtained. During training, hyperparameters (such as the penalty factor and kernel function type) should be optimized through methods such as grid search and random search, with early stopping, regularization, and other strategies employed to prevent overfitting. Model ensemble and fusion, such as Bagging, Boosting, etc., can be used to improve model robustness and generalization performance. In practical applications, model inference speed and resource consumption must also be considered. Techniques like model compression, quantization, and pruning can be used to achieve model light-weighting and acceleration.\n\n2.3 Model Evaluation and Optimization  \nAfter constructing the smart grid load forecasting model, it needs to be comprehensively evaluated and optimized to ensure its forecasting performance and practical value. The evaluation process typically involves methods such as holdout and cross-validation, dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. Common evaluation metrics include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's forecasting accuracy and stability. For example, the RMSE calculation formula is:  \nIn the formula, n is the number of samples, yi is the actual value, and is the predicted value. RMSE considers the square term of the error, making it more sensitive to large errors and reflecting the overall predictive performance of the model. During evaluation, attention should also be paid to issues like overfitting and underfitting, with techniques such as learning curve plotting and residual analysis used to diagnose the model’s generalization ability and limitations. Additionally, the model’s robustness and interpretability should be evaluated, examining the model's adaptability to different data distributions, noise interference, and abnormal events, as well as the comprehensibility of its decision-making process and influencing factors. Based on the evaluation results, further optimization and improvement of the model are necessary. Optimization strategies include feature engineering, algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensemble. Feature engineering aims to extract more effective and relevant features from raw data, such as using domain knowledge to construct expert features or applying automatic feature selection and extraction algorithms. Algorithm selection involves comparing the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of different algorithms based on the characteristics and requirements of the problem, choosing the best modeling method. Hyperparameter tuning involves systematically searching and evaluating different combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for model performance, using methods like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Model ensemble combines multiple base models into a more powerful model, using strategies like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking to improve prediction performance by reducing the effects of variance, bias, and noise. Additionally, the model’s computational efficiency and resource consumption should be considered, exploring techniques like model compression, pruning, and quantization to achieve model light-weighting and real-time deployment while meeting performance requirements.\n\n3. Exploration of Optimized Dispatch Strategies  \nBased on accurate load forecasting results, the optimized dispatch strategies for smart grids aim to achieve the safe, economic, and efficient operation of the power system. Traditional dispatch strategies typically use deterministic optimization methods, such as linear programming and mixed-integer programming, but these methods struggle to accommodate the randomness and volatility characteristics of new energy sources. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce advanced methods such as robust optimization, stochastic optimization, and intelligent optimization to build more flexible and adaptable dispatch models. Robust optimization accounts for load forecasting errors and the uncertainty of new energy output by introducing uncertainty sets and robust strategies to solve for the optimal dispatch scheme under the worst-case scenario, ensuring the feasibility and optimality of the system within certain uncertainty bounds. Stochastic optimization uses probability distribution functions to characterize the random characteristics of load and new energy, generating scenarios and reduction methods to obtain the optimal dispatch strategy in an expected sense and evaluate economic benefits and risk levels under different scenarios. Intelligent optimization integrates modern heuristic algorithms and machine learning techniques, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and reinforcement learning, to intelligently search and adaptively learn, finding approximate optimal solutions to complex nonlinear and non-convex optimization problems and continuously adapting to dynamic system changes and uncertain disturbances. Taking robust optimization as an example, its mathematical model can be represented as:  \nObjective function:  \nConstraints:  \nIn the formula, x is the decision variable, u is the uncertain parameter, X is the decision space, U is the uncertainty set, f(x, u) is the objective function, and gi(x, u) are the constraint conditions. This model seeks the optimal decision under the worst-case scenario, ensuring that the maximum value of the objective function is minimized under any uncertain parameters while satisfying the constraints. Through dual theory and decomposition algorithms, the robust optimization problem can be transformed into a form that is easier to solve, and applied to real-time dispatch and risk management in smart grids.\n\n4. Empirical Analysis and Simulation Verification  \n4.1 Simulation Experiment Scheme  \nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed smart grid load forecasting model and optimized dispatch strategies based on artificial intelligence technology, a series of simulation experiments were designed. The experimental data comes from historical load and meteorological data from an electric grid in a town in Songjiang, Shanghai, with a time span of two years and a time granularity of 1 hour. First, data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed to extract the trend, periodicity, and randomness features of the load curve, as well as weather factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Then, models such as LSTM, SVM, and RF were used for load forecasting, and RMSE, MAE, and MAPE were used to evaluate forecasting performance. On this basis, combined with the grid’s topology and operational constraints, robust optimization, stochastic optimization, and intelligent optimization dispatch models were constructed and compared with traditional deterministic optimization methods. By setting different levels of load forecasting errors and new energy penetration rates, the performance of different dispatch strategies in terms of economy, safety, and environmental protection was analyzed, along with sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization. Additionally, the computational efficiency and convergence speed of the models were examined, and algorithm improvements and deployment solutions in practical applications were discussed.\n\n4.2 Experimental Results and Analysis  \nAccording to the simulation experiment scheme, comprehensive testing and evaluation of different load forecasting models and optimized dispatch strategies were conducted. Table 1 shows the performance comparison of the various forecasting models under different evaluation metrics, indicating that the LSTM model outperforms the SVM and RF models in RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and other metrics, demonstrating its advantages in capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear features. Table 2 presents the comparison results of different dispatch strategies in terms of economic, safety, and environmental protection metrics. Among them, robust optimization and stochastic optimization strategies performed excellently in addressing load forecasting errors and new energy uncertainties, effectively reducing operating costs, improving power supply reliability, and reducing environmental emissions. The intelligent optimization strategy demonstrated good global search capabilities and convergence speed when solving complex nonlinear optimization problems, and it was able to adapt to dynamic changes and uncertain disturbances in the system.\n\nTable 1: Load Forecasting Model Performance Comparison  \nTable 2: Optimized Dispatch Strategy Performance Comparison  \n\nA comprehensive analysis of the experimental results from Tables 1 and 2 leads to the following conclusions: First, load forecasting models based on artificial intelligence technology, especially the LSTM model, can effectively improve forecasting accuracy, providing more reliable data support for optimized dispatch. Second, by introducing advanced dispatch strategies such as robust optimization, stochastic optimization, and intelligent optimization, it is possible to comprehensively consider the economy, safety, and environmental protection of the power system, with clear advantages in addressing load forecasting errors and new energy uncertainties. Third, model integration and algorithm improvement can further enhance the performance of load forecasting and optimized dispatch, enabling real-time deployment and adaptive updating of the model. In conclusion, the methods proposed in this paper provide new ideas and approaches for the efficient operation and sustainable development of smart grids, with broad application prospects and promotional value.\n\n5.

Based on the thesis topic and the literature reviewed, write a literature review of approximately 2000 words:  \n\n**Exchange rate** is the ratio of one country's currency to another country's currency. It is one of the most important comprehensive price indicators in international economic activities and plays a crucial role in price conversion in international finance and trade. Its fluctuations have a profound impact on the balance of foreign trade and domestic economic activity.  \n\n### **Literature Review**  \n\n#### **I. Research Background and Significance**  \n\nWith the continuous development of economic globalization, foreign trade serves as a crucial driver of economic growth, promoting the efficient allocation of resources, the introduction of advanced technologies, equipment, and management methods. It plays a pivotal role in the rapid development of China's economy, reflecting China's position in international division of labor, its importance in global economic exchanges and cooperation, and the degree of integration between China’s economy and the global economy.  \n\nThe exchange rate, as the ratio of one country's currency to another's, is a key comprehensive price indicator in international economic activities. It connects domestic and international prices and determines the relative prices of goods and services in international trade. Exchange rate fluctuations significantly impact a country's trade balance and domestic economic activity. Many countries adjust their exchange rates to balance their trade.  \n\nAs China becomes more integrated into the global economy, the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on foreign trade has become increasingly significant. Since 1981, China has adopted a dual exchange rate system. In 1994, the RMB exchange rate was established as a managed floating exchange rate based on market supply and demand. By 1996, China achieved full convertibility of the RMB under the current account. Today, under the \"pegged to the U.S. dollar\" system, every major adjustment in the nominal and real RMB exchange rates has been closely linked to import and export trade conditions. The periodic fluctuations of the RMB exchange rate have had a profound impact on exports and imports, and there is a significant correlation between changes in the real effective exchange rate of the RMB and the development of China's foreign trade.  \n\nSince the 1997 Southeast Asian financial crisis, China's foreign trade has been severely affected, prompting calls for RMB devaluation to boost exports. Over the years, Western countries have continued to pressure China to appreciate the RMB. The UK first published the \"Cheap Chinese Currency\" argument in 2001, promoting the so-called \"China threat theory.\" The U.S. officially stated that it hoped for a more flexible RMB exchange rate. In 2002, Japan proposed a scheme at the OECD G7 meeting, urging RMB appreciation and attempting to create a second \"Plaza Accord.\" In 2003, Japan accused China of exporting deflation to Asian countries. The motivation behind Western developed countries’ efforts to force RMB appreciation stems from China's massive trade surplus, capital account surplus, and large foreign exchange reserves.  \n\nThe issue of RMB exchange rate fluctuations has become a hot topic in international discussions, particularly concerning global trade balance and China’s trade balance. Key questions include: How much do exchange rate fluctuations impact China's trade balance and trade surplus? Can China use exchange rate policy to stimulate export growth, improve the structure of imports and exports, and further promote economic development? Can RMB appreciation balance China's trade balance without disrupting the country’s steady economic growth, thereby addressing concerns from Western countries about an undervalued RMB?  \n\n### **II. Current Research Status at Home and Abroad**  \n\n#### **(1) Domestic Research Status**  \n\n- *Shanghai Securities News*: Since the RMB exchange rate reform on July 21, 2005, the RMB has been in a continuous appreciation trend against the U.S. dollar. Analysts predict that the RMB will continue to appreciate in 2007 and may accelerate. The main reasons are:  \n  1. China’s international balance of payments surplus will continue to expand, and foreign exchange reserves will maintain rapid growth.  \n  2. The RMB appreciation rate against the U.S. dollar is slower than the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the British pound, indicating that the RMB still has significant appreciation potential.  \n  3. The victory of the Democratic Party in the U.S. elections may increase pressure for a rapid appreciation of the RMB.  \n\n- *Zhou Yu (2007)*: Examined the impact of changing times and environments on the RMB exchange rate mechanism. Amid numerous conflicting phenomena, events, and opinions, the author sought to explore the logic and driving forces behind changes in the RMB exchange rate and exchange rate mechanism.  \n\n- By 2008, the RMB/USD central parity rate was reported at 6.9408, rising slightly by 24 basis points compared to the previous trading day. Economist Jin Yanshi predicted that RMB appreciation would continue until the end of the following year. He also anticipated a shift from rapid to slower appreciation based on the economic trends of the United States. The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis began in 2007, led to a recession in 2008, and was expected to recover by 2009. As the U.S. dollar regained strength, it would influence the pace of RMB appreciation.  \n\n- *Liu Yuhui*, director of the China Economic Evaluation Center at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that the short-term slowdown in RMB appreciation in April of that year was mainly due to a temporary rebound in the U.S. dollar against other currencies. However, this did not indicate a fundamental improvement in the U.S. economy. Instead, it reflected weaker-than-expected economic conditions in the EU and Japan.  \n\n- Nobel laureate *Paul Krugman* wrote an article on March 14, 2010, titled *Taking On China*, arguing that the \"highly distorted\" RMB exchange rate was \"harming the world.\" He urged the U.S. government not to fear angering China and suggested imposing a 25% punitive tariff on Chinese imports if the RMB did not appreciate significantly.  \n\n### **III. Theoretical Overview of the Topic**  \n\nExchange rate fluctuations impact trade balance by affecting the prices and quantities of exported and imported goods. Early discussions on this topic date back to the **mercantilist school**, which viewed currency as the only wealth and advocated export incentives while restricting imports to accumulate monetary wealth. Mercantilists believed that devaluing a country’s currency in exchange transactions was beneficial because it made domestic goods cheaper for foreigners while making foreign goods more expensive domestically, thus increasing monetary inflows.  \n\nLater, economists such as **Marshall, Lerner, and Metzler** developed the **elasticity approach**, analyzing how changes in exchange rates alter the relative prices of traded goods and thus impact trade balance. This approach highlighted the necessary conditions for exchange rate adjustments to balance trade and incorporated the effects of trade terms.  \n\nMeanwhile, the **monetary approach** to balance of payments, based on general equilibrium analysis, emphasized the role of macroeconomic factors in responding to devaluation. It stated that trade balance results from the difference between national income and domestic absorption, with exchange rate fluctuations influencing trade by altering income and spending levels.  \n\nSince the 1970s, as most countries adopted floating exchange rate systems, new theories and methods have emerged to analyze the impact of exchange rate changes on trade balances. Economists have increasingly focused on the **long-term effects** of exchange rate fluctuations on international trade, using microeconomic analysis to study macroeconomic issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Presentation PPT Outline**  \n\n1. **Title Page**  \n   - Research title  \n   - Name and date  \n\n2. **Introduction**  \n   - Name and academic level  \n   - Advisor’s name and contact information  \n   - Research topic and objectives  \n   - Statement of research questions  \n   - Research significance and potential impact  \n\n3. **Literature Review**  \n   - Key findings from existing research  \n   - Current state and future trends in the field  \n   - Research gaps and unresolved issues  \n   - How this research addresses these gaps  \n\n4. **Research Methods**  \n   - Research design (experiment, survey, case study, etc.)  \n   - Data collection methods  \n   - Tools and techniques used  \n   - Data analysis approach  \n\n5. **Timeline and Expected Results**  \n   - Start and end dates of research  \n   - Key findings anticipated at different stages  \n   - Estimated completion date  \n\n6. **Conclusion and Outlook**  \n   - Summary of key points  \n   - Future research directions  \n   - Acknowledgments  \n   - References (if needed)", "criteria": [{"name": "Content Organization Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the speech follows the provided PPT framework while effectively incorporating thesis content and maintaining the 10-minute time constraint", "1-2": "Speech completely disregards PPT structure, fails to incorporate thesis content, and significantly exceeds or falls short of time limit", "3-4": "Poor alignment with PPT framework, inadequate integration of thesis content, and notable timing issues", "5-6": "Generally follows PPT structure with basic thesis content integration, roughly meets time constraint", "7-8": "Good alignment with PPT framework, effective thesis content integration, with minor timing adjustments needed", "9-10": "Perfect alignment with PPT structure, seamless thesis content integration, and precise 10-minute timing"}, {"name": "Academic Depth and Accuracy", "criteria_description": "Assesses the comprehensive coverage of economic concepts, accuracy of information, and scholarly presentation of research findings", "1-2": "Contains major factual errors, lacks academic rigor, and misrepresents key economic concepts", "3-4": "Shows superficial understanding, contains several inaccuracies, and inadequate academic depth", "5-6": "Demonstrates basic academic understanding with occasional minor errors or oversimplifications", "7-8": "Shows strong academic depth with minimal inaccuracies and good theoretical foundation", "9-10": "Exhibits excellent academic depth, perfect accuracy, and sophisticated understanding of economic concepts"}, {"name": "Presentation Clarity", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the logical flow, coherence, and effectiveness of information delivery for a defense presentation context", "1-2": "Extremely confusing, disjointed, and impossible to follow", "3-4": "Unclear presentation with frequent logical gaps and poor transitions", "5-6": "Moderately clear with occasional confusion in flow and structure", "7-8": "Clear and well-structured with minor improvements possible in transitions", "9-10": "Exceptionally clear, perfectly structured, and professionally presented"}, {"name": "Research Context Integration", "criteria_description": "Measures how effectively the speech incorporates literature review, methodology, and research significance", "1-2": "Fails to address research context, methodology, or significance", "3-4": "Poorly integrates research elements with significant gaps in coverage", "5-6": "Adequately covers research elements but lacks depth in some areas", "7-8": "Strong integration of research elements with minor gaps in coverage", "9-10": "Comprehensive and balanced coverage of all research elements"}, {"name": "Defense Readiness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the speech anticipates and addresses potential questions while demonstrating command of the subject matter", "1-2": "Shows no preparation for potential questions or critique", "3-4": "Inadequately prepared for defense with major gaps in subject matter coverage", "5-6": "Shows basic preparation but lacks depth in addressing potential challenges", "7-8": "Well-prepared with good coverage of potential questions and critiques", "9-10": "Exceptionally prepared with comprehensive coverage and strong command of subject matter"}]}

、首席宏观分析师 张瑜（执业证号：S0360518090001）\n\n主要原材料、能源价格走势数据：\n1.各类商品及服务价格同比变动情况12月份，食品烟酒类价格同比持平。食品中，鲜果价格下降3.0%，影响CPI（居民消费价格指数）下降约0.06个百分点；粮食价格下降1.3%，影响CPI下降约0.02个百分点；畜肉类价格上涨1.7%，影响CPI上涨约0.05个百分点，其中猪肉价格上涨12.5%，影响CPI上涨约0.15个百分点；水产品价格上涨1.0%，影响CPI上涨约0.02个百分点；鲜菜价格上涨0.5%，影响CPI上涨约0.01个百分点。其他七大类价格同比五涨两降。其中，其他用品及服务、衣着价格分别上涨4.9%和1.2%，教育文化娱乐、医疗保健价格均上涨0.9%，居住价格上涨0.1%；交通通信、生活用品及服务价格分别下降2.2%和0.7%。\n2.各类商品及服务价格环比变动情况12月份，食品烟酒类价格环比下降0.3%，影响CPI下降约0.09个百分点。食品中，鲜菜价格下降2.4%，影响CPI下降约0.05个百分点；畜肉类价格下降1.3%，影响CPI下降约0.04个百分点，其中猪肉价格下降2.1%，影响CPI下降约0.03个百分点；鲜果价格下降1.0%，影响CPI下降约0.02个百分点。其他七大类价格环比四涨两平一降。其中，生活用品及服务、交通通信价格均上涨0.3%，衣着、居住价格分别上涨0.2%和0.1%；教育文化娱乐、其他用品及服务价格均持平；医疗保健价格下降0.1%。\n\n行业工资水平变动数据：\n人力资源服务商前程无忧51job通过调研形成的《2025离职与调薪报告》（下称“报告”）显示，2024年，调薪企业比例仅为44.8%，较2023年下降13.9个百分点。同时，企业整体调薪幅度为4.3%，较上年度下降0.2个百分点。企业在薪资调整上呈现出谨慎保守的态势。\n\n分城市来看，报告显示，新一线城市的调薪幅度为4.3%，与一线城市基本持平。近年来，新一线城市通过产业升级和政策支持吸引了大量人才，在职场竞争力上不断追赶一线。相比之下，二、三线城市的调薪幅度较低，这与其产业结构单一、经济活力不足密切相关。\n\n尽管企业的调薪比例降至低点，但职场人对工作的整体满意度并未大幅下滑。报告显示，面向C端的问卷中，近七成受访者对2024年的工作表示满意。相对乐观的结果背后，薪资上涨起到了关键作用。不少受访者实现了涨薪，而受益者集中在1—5年经验的职场人，有一定工作经历但尚未达到职业天花板，受到了企业关注。\n\n在调薪策略上，报告显示，“按照绩效评估结果差异化调薪”和“针对核心员工倾斜调薪”依然是主要方式，占比分别为45.9%和39.3%，其中“针对核心员工倾斜调薪”的比例较2023年（33.7%）有所上涨。\n\n除了薪酬调整，报告也对就业中被广泛关注的离职问题做了调研。报告显示，2024年，员工和企业普遍倾向于保持稳定。其中，2024年员工整体离职率为15.3%，较上年度下降1.3个百分点。进一步分析发现，离职率较高的行业集中在餐饮/酒店/旅游（16.7%）、高科技（16.1%）以及房地产（15.9%）；而离职率较低的行业则包括医药健康（13.6%）和金融（13.8%）。\n\n尽管离职率有所下降，但职场人对薪资待遇和职业发展的诉求依旧强烈。报告通过问卷调查发现，44%的离职者因薪资待遇不满意，40%因发展空间有限，37%为了更好的职业机会，31%的人表示工作压力过大，28%提到工作与生活的平衡问题。\n\n展望2025年，职场人对就业市场的信心有所提升。64%的人表示“比较有信心”，而36%的受访者则持谨慎态度。同时，报告预计，2025年企业的调薪幅度将与2024年大致持平，为4.2%。\n\n国家相关部门发布的通胀调控政策文件：\n1.实施紧缩性货币政策根据《中华人民共和国中国人民银行法》第二条，中国人民银行是中华人民共和国的中央银行，负责制定和执行货币政策。在通货膨胀时期，中国人民银行可以采取紧缩性货币政策，通过减少货币供应量来抑制物价上涨。具体措施包括：提高法定存款准备金率，以减少商业银行可用于贷款的资金量，从而降低市场货币流通量。提高再贴现率，增加商业银行向中央银行借款的成本，减少其贷款意愿，进而控制货币供应量。在公开市场上卖出有价证券，回收市场多余的货币，减少市场的货币流通量。\n2.实施紧缩性财政政策政府可以通过实施紧缩性财政政策，减少政府支出和增加税收，以降低总需求，从而抑制通货膨胀。具体措施包括：削减政府预算，减少政府购买和转移支付，以降低公共支出对总需求的刺激作用。增加税收，尤其是针对高收入群体和消费品征收的税收，以降低私人消费和投资需求。\n3.实行价格管制和供给调节政府可以对重要商品和服务的价格进行管制，防止价格过快上涨。同时，通过调节供给结构，增加短缺商品的供给，以缓解供需矛盾。具体措施包括：对重要商品和服务实行最高限价政策，防止价格暴涨。通过政府补贴、税收优惠等手段鼓励企业增加短缺商品的供给。加强市场监管，打击囤积居奇、哄抬物价等违法行为。\n4.推进经济结构调整和转型升级通货膨胀往往与经济结构失衡和产能过剩等问题相伴而生。因此，政府可以推进经济结构调整和转型升级，以提高经济效率和竞争力，从根本上解决通货膨胀问题。具体措施包括：优化产业结构，淘汰落后产能，发展新兴产业和高技术产业。加强创新驱动，提高自主创新能力，推动产业升级和产品质量提升。深化改革开放，完善市场经济体制，提高资源配置效率。综上所述，针对通货膨胀可以采取紧缩性货币政策、紧缩性财政政策、价格管制和供给调节以及推进经济结构调整和转型升级等政策措施。这些措施的实施需要综合考虑国内外经济形势、政策效果和社会承受能力等因素，以确保政策的针对性和有效性。\n\n\n\n请基于最新的CPI和PPI数据，撰写一份2500字左右的通胀形势分析简报。该简报将用于企业高管季度经营分析会议，需采用专业严谨的商务语言风格。具体要求如下：\n-

Annual Court Trial Work Summary Conference Speech\n\nRespected leaders and colleagues, good day!\n\nToday, we gather here to summarize the judicial work of the past year, review achievements, identify problems, and clarify direction. Here, on behalf of the court's trial team, I will report on our judicial work in 2023.\n\n1. Major Achievements of the Past Year\n\n2023 was a year full of challenges and opportunities. Facing rapid social and economic development, continuous updates in laws and regulations, and the growing legal needs of the people, our court, under the strong leadership of superior courts and the Party Committee, has consistently adhered to the concept of \"fair justice and service to the people,\" striving to improve trial quality and efficiency, achieving notable results.\n\nCase Acceptance: In 2023, our court accepted 12,500 cases of various types, a 15% increase year-on-year. This included 6,000 civil cases, 3,200 criminal cases, 1,300 administrative cases, 1,000 commercial cases, and 1,000 enforcement cases. Despite the significant increase in total cases, we ensured efficient case handling through optimized case flow and trial mechanisms.\n\nTrial Quality and Efficiency Improvement: We concluded 12,200 cases throughout the year, achieving a 97% completion rate, up 4 percentage points from last year. Particularly in civil cases, family disputes, and traffic accident cases, we accurately addressed public concerns, resolved numerous conflicts, and maintained social harmony and stability.\n\nTrial Procedure Reform: In 2023, we further promoted the construction of \"smart courts,\" optimizing case trials through modern information technology. The comprehensive application of electronic case files improved trial efficiency, reducing average case trial duration by 10%.\n\nFair Trial and Execution: We strictly followed legal provisions, promoting precise law enforcement and legally handling several major cases. For example, in the economic crime case of XX Enterprise, we legally held senior management accountable, fully demonstrating equality before the law.\n\n2. Existing Problems and Shortcomings\n\nDespite achievements, we face several challenges that need addressing in future work.\n\nSurge in Cases, Increased Trial Pressure: The continuous growth in case numbers has increased our trial pressure. Despite increased staffing, some case trials still face delays, affecting trial quality and efficiency.\n\nEnforcement Difficulties: While we've made progress in enforcement work, difficulties in executing certain cases remain prominent, with some cases having lengthy enforcement periods, affecting judicial credibility.\n\nShortage of Judges: Currently, we still lack sufficient judges, affecting the timely trial of some complex cases.\n\nLitigation Services and Public Satisfaction: Though we've continuously optimized litigation services and improved public understanding of court work, some people remain dissatisfied with court decisions, occasionally leading to irrational litigation behavior.\n\n3. Future Work Plans and Goals\n\nFor 2024's tasks, we will improve judicial work in the following aspects:\n\nStrengthen Case Handling Intelligence: Continue smart court construction, optimize case flow and trial processes, shorten trial periods, and improve efficiency. Aim to reduce case trial duration by another 10% in 2024.\n\nDeepen Enforcement Work: Strengthen enforcement efforts, implement responsibility systems, further promote \"smart enforcement\" reform, and enhance transparency and fairness. We plan to achieve 100% case completion in 2024, reducing backlog.\n\nTalent Development and Team Building: Further strengthen judge team training, enhance comprehensive quality and professional capabilities. Actively seek more judicial resources to ensure efficient trial work.\n\nStrengthen Communication with Society: While conducting trials, continue strengthening communication with the public and various industries, enhance public legal awareness, and improve judicial transparency and public satisfaction.\n\nPromote Universal Legal Services: Actively promote online litigation service platforms, expand convenient litigation service channels, especially legal services for vulnerable groups, ensuring easier access to judicial services.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nLooking back at 2023, we had achievements and shortcomings, but most importantly, we maintained our pursuit of fair justice, continuously innovating and steadily advancing court work. Looking forward to 2024, we will continue strengthening team building, improving trial quality, enhancing enforcement, and further improving the court's judicial credibility.\n\nFinally, I want to especially thank all leaders and colleagues for their support and help, and every judge and staff member who has worked diligently for the court. In the new year, we will continue to be people-centered, continuously improve trial standards, and build a more just and efficient judicial environment.\n\nThank you all!", "criteria": [{"name": "structural_organization", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the meeting minutes are organized, including clear sections, logical flow, and appropriate hierarchical structure of information", "1-2": "No clear structure, information presented randomly with no logical organization or sections", "3-4": "Basic structure present but inconsistent, with unclear transitions and poorly organized subsections", "5-6": "Adequate structure with main sections identified, though some organizational elements could be improved", "7-8": "Well-organized with clear sections and subsections, minor improvements possible in transitions or hierarchy", "9-10": "Excellent organization with clear sections, logical flow, and perfect hierarchical structure maintaining professional meeting minutes format"}, {"name": "content_preservation", "criteria_description": "Assesses how effectively the minutes retain critical information from the original speech while maintaining the specified word count", "1-2": "Major omissions of crucial information, key statistics and data missing or incorrect", "3-4": "Significant information gaps, some important points overlooked or misrepresented", "5-6": "Most essential information preserved, though some secondary details missing", "7-8": "Nearly all important information retained with minimal loss of critical content", "9-10": "Perfect balance of information retention within word limit, all crucial points preserved accurately"}, {"name": "professional_formatting", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the formatting consistency, use of appropriate headers, and professional presentation of meeting minutes", "1-2": "Inconsistent or inappropriate formatting throughout, lacking professional appearance", "3-4": "Basic formatting attempted but with multiple inconsistencies and style issues", "5-6": "Adequate formatting with some inconsistencies in style or presentation", "7-8": "Professional formatting with minor inconsistencies in style elements", "9-10": "Exemplary professional formatting throughout, consistent style and presentation"}, {"name": "conciseness_clarity", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the content is condensed while maintaining clarity and readability", "1-2": "Verbose or unclear writing, significant redundancy or confusion in expression", "3-4": "Some unnecessary verbosity, occasional unclear or redundant passages", "5-6": "Generally clear writing with some opportunities for further condensation", "7-8": "Concise and clear writing with minimal redundancy", "9-10": "Perfectly concise and clear expression, no unnecessary words while maintaining all essential meaning"}, {"name": "data_accuracy", "criteria_description": "Assesses the accuracy and proper presentation of numerical data, statistics, and specific figures from the original speech", "1-2": "Multiple errors in data presentation, missing or incorrect numbers", "3-4": "Some inaccuracies in numerical data, inconsistent presentation of figures", "5-6": "Most data accurately presented with some minor inconsistencies", "7-8": "Nearly all data accurately presented with consistent formatting", "9-10": "Perfect accuracy in all numerical data with professional and consistent presentation"}]}

{"index": 179, "domain1": "Politics & Law", "domain2": "White Paper", "query": "Write me a white paper on the establishment of specialized environmental justice institutions,\nIncluding the following specific case analysis: First Environmental Public Interest Lawsuit in Xiamen Supported by Intermediate Court - Case Details\n\nEnvironment Has \"Value,\" Damage Bears Responsibility\n\nA man in Xiamen, without any proper qualifications, arbitrarily set up a large-scale pig farm on contracted land, causing widespread environmental pollution. Recently, the Xiamen Intermediate People's Court made a first-instance judgment in the environmental pollution liability public interest lawsuit between the plaintiff, Fujian Environmental Volunteers Association, and the defendant Ye. The court ordered the defendant to pay 917,500 yuan in environmental pollution compensation to a government special account for environmental restoration, and to make a public apology through provincial or higher-level media.\n\nAs Xiamen's first environmental public interest lawsuit, this case has received widespread attention. The principle that environment has \"value\" and violations will be prosecuted undoubtedly serves as a warning to society.\n\nPursuing Responsibility: Environmental Protection Association Takes Pig Farmer to Court\n\nIn October 2017, the Fujian Environmental Volunteers Association filed a lawsuit against Xiamen resident Mr. Ye.\n\nThe plaintiff, Fujian Environmental Volunteers Association, is a non-governmental organization, a public welfare and non-profit social organization consisting of enterprises and volunteers dedicated to environmental protection. Why sue an individual? The story goes back fifteen years.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, without obtaining proper approval documents, Ye arbitrarily built pigsties, management houses, and solidified ground for operating a large-scale pig farm on contracted land. The total area of the farm reached over 14,000 square meters, with nearly 15,000 pigs. Environmental protection agencies determined that Ye's farm was located within 500 meters of surrounding villages and roads, within a government-designated livestock farming prohibited zone. Moreover, Ye did not take measures to treat livestock manure, carcasses, and wastewater.\n\nIn November 2016, the Tong'an Branch of Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau issued an order requiring Ye to stop large-scale pig farming and handle the disposal of pigs and close or demolish the farm. In January 2017, the farm was demolished. The urban management department determined that Ye was suspected of illegally occupying agricultural land and transferred the case to public security authorities. In August 2017, the farm was designated as a pig farming transition project; in January 2018, this transition project passed inspection...\n\nAlthough administrative penalties were issued and subsequent rectification was in progress, how should the environmental damage already caused be compensated? The Fujian Environmental Volunteers Association believed that the defendant Ye should bear environmental damage compensation responsibility. Therefore, the association filed a lawsuit with the Xiamen Intermediate Court, requesting the court to order the defendants to pay 1.5 million yuan in compensation for environmental pollution damages, with the funds to be paid to a special treasury account for ecological restoration, and to make a public apology.\n\nHow to Determine Damages: Intermediate Court Takes Initiative to Resolve Trial Difficulties\n\n\"The main focus of dispute in this case was how to determine environmental damage consequences after the physical evidence of Ye's large-scale pig farming environmental pollution had disappeared,\" explained Judge Wang Chi, who handled the case. \"Particularly challenging was determining the damage to public interest in terms of environmental pollution.\"\n\nFacing these difficulties, the Xiamen Intermediate Court demonstrated judicial initiative. Given the major dispute over damage consequences due to the disappearance of environmental pollution evidence, the court initiated judicial assessment of environmental damage consequences based on Article 8 of the Supreme People's Court's interpretation regarding environmental tort liability cases.\n\n\"Public interest litigation differs from general civil litigation. Recognizing this, we needed to exercise appropriate judicial authority principles. When parties disputed whether assessment was needed and which assessment institution to choose, we initiated damage assessment by authority and designated qualified assessment institutions,\" Wang explained, noting that they ultimately used the virtual treatment cost method to assess environmental damage consequences.\n\nThe virtual treatment cost method is one approach to environmental value assessment that has been gradually applied in current environmental damage assessment practice. According to relevant national laws, applying this method in this case solved the difficulty of assessing damage consequences when physical evidence of pollution had disappeared.\n\nDuring the trial, by May 2018, site inspection showed the farm had been completely converted to vegetable greenhouses. The Xiamen Intermediate Court authorized Lisi Judicial Assessment Institute to evaluate the environmental damage. The assessment report stated that the total environmental damage value caused by Ye's illegal discharge of pollutants from pig farming was 917,500 yuan.\n\nAfter trial, the Xiamen Intermediate Court found that Ye conducted large-scale pig farming in a prohibited area without proper environmental impact assessment and comprehensive pollution treatment, causing environmental pollution damage. The court deemed Lisi Judicial Assessment Institute's use of the virtual treatment cost method appropriate and consistent with the case's circumstances, making their assessment valid evidence for determining environmental damage consequences.\n\nTherefore, the Xiamen Intermediate Court made a first-instance judgment requiring farm owner Ye to pay 917,500 yuan in environmental pollution compensation to a government special account for environmental restoration.\n\nWarning Bell: Environmental Protection Should Mobilize All Social Forces\n\nThe ecological environment is a typical public resource. To reduce the \"tragedy of the commons\" phenomenon and effectively curb \"free-riding\" on environmental resources, implementing the basic principle that \"environment has value, use requires payment, and damage bears responsibility,\" relevant Chinese laws clearly stipulate that qualified social organizations have the right to file civil public interest lawsuits against actions that pollute the environment and harm public interests.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff Fujian Environmental Volunteers Association legally submitted its social organization legal person registration certificate, association charter, relevant honorary certificates, and other documents, meeting requirements including \"specially engaging in environmental protection public interest activities.\" The court therefore accepted its standing as plaintiff.\n\n\"Previously, environmental damage lawsuits were mainly filed by government departments, but in this case, a social public interest organization served as plaintiff. With support from civil forces, environmental protection departments are no longer 'fighting alone' in promoting environmental protection,\" said Zhang Pengkui, Deputy Director of the Tong'an Branch of Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau.\n\n\"This can effectively protect national interests and social order from illegal actions, eliminating violations at their early stages,\" Zhang said. \"This case also demonstrates to some extent that the environment has 'value,' and it's necessary to make those who damage the environment pay economic compensation for their actions. No matter who you are or what kind of production and business activities you engage in, you should always remember your social and legal responsibilities to protect the environment.

{"index": 213, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Prose", "query": "Help me write an essay about the artistic conception of Chinese landscape painting, around 2000 words. Draw inspiration from Su Shi's \"Red Cliff Ode\" in terms of writing techniques and imagery, while incorporating insights gained from art enthusiasts during their sketching and copying of ancient landscape paintings. You can refer to the following content: The Red Cliff\n\nIn the autumn of the year Ren-xu, after the full moon of the seventh month, I went boating with guests below the Red Cliff. A gentle breeze arose, but the river remained calm. I raised my cup to my guests, reciting poems about the bright moon and singing verses of beauty. Shortly after, the moon rose above the eastern mountains, wandering between the constellations of the Dipper and the Ox. White dew lay across the river, where water merged with sky. Our small boat drifted freely across the vast expanse, as if floating through the air, not knowing where we might stop; we felt like immortals, detached from the worldly realm.\n\nWe drank joyfully and sang, drumming on the boat's side. The song went: \"With cassia oars and orchid paddles, we strike the clear void and trace the flowing light. My heart wanders far, yearning for my beloved in a distant corner of heaven.\" One guest played a bamboo flute, accompanying the song. The sound was mournful, like crying and pleading, with lingering notes thin as silk threads, stirring hidden dragons in deep valleys and moving widows in lonely boats.\n\nI grew solemn and asked the guest, \"Why do you play so?\" The guest replied, \"Under the bright moon and sparse stars, where crows fly south - isn't this from Cao Mengde's poem? Looking west to Xiakou and east to Wuchang, where mountains and rivers interweave in deep green - isn't this where Mengde was troubled by Zhou Yu? When he conquered Jingzhou and took Jiangling, sailing east downstream, his boats stretched a thousand li, his banners darkened the sky. He drank by the river and composed poems with his spear laid across his lap - truly a hero of his time. But where is he now? Here we are, fishing and gathering firewood by the river, befriending fish and deer, rowing a small boat, sharing wine gourds. We are but mayflies between heaven and earth, grains of sand in the vast sea. I lament life's brevity while admiring the endless Yangtze. Though we cannot immediately achieve immortality, we leave our echoes in the sorrowful wind.\"\n\nI said, \"Do you understand water and moon? The flowing water never truly departs; the moon waxes and wanes but never truly changes. From the perspective of change, heaven and earth don't last an instant; from the perspective of unchanging, everything, including ourselves, is endless. Why envy anything? Moreover, in this world, everything has its owner. What isn't ours, we shouldn't take, even a hair's worth. Only the river's clean breeze and mountain's bright moon are free - they become sound when heard, color when seen, can be taken without restriction and used without exhaustion. This is nature's endless treasury, which you and I share.\"\n\nThe guest laughed with joy, and we washed our cups for more wine.

{"index": 217, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Prose", "query": "我是一名70后的老唱片收藏爱好者，仿照范文里的文风和措辞，写一篇以老唱片为主题的散文，里面加入几首八九十年代有记忆点的曲目，3000～4000字。范文: 欧键汶送了四支笔，樊利杰送了两支笔，张敏送了两支笔，朱长根寄来十九支笔，唐燕琳寄来八支笔……\n这是前些日子朋友与学生给我毛笔时，我做的一个记录。有的笔杆上还用娟秀的楷书刻了我的名字，是笔庄专门制作的。它们有的用来写榜书，有的只能写小楷。它们的装饰各有不同：有的笔躺在考究的锦盒里，显示出高贵的神情；有的连简装都没有，来人从提袋里取出两支，递给我，说“试试”。包装不包装，对我来说是没用的，能不能用，才是我所关心的。\n我说的是毛笔。\n每一管笔，在未启用时都是锋棱尖锐的，似乎可以把点画的细处毫厘不爽地勾勒出来。只有付之于水，让水把千百毫毛化开，试用，才可以断其优劣。\n有书写癖好的人，笔是越多越好。笔多了，就有一个广大的选择空间，用来写行草，或者写篆隶、落款。如果写小楷，更是讲究笔锋之美。每位书写者都会根据自己的书写习惯去选择，长锋或者短锋，软毫或者硬毫——毕竟，拥有一管称心的笔，那是很开怀的。\n在一个文学活动的入口处，有一本红色的洒金册页摊开着，旁边是一方厚实的砚台，搁着一支毛笔，还有一支硬笔，让与会者签名，使这本册页承担一些纪念的责任——如果没有这本册页，来的人直接就登堂入室了。而现在，略微停顿一下。有的人选择了毛笔，拈起来，濡墨，一气呵成。有人选择硬笔，也拈起来，不必濡墨，也一气呵成。很明显，执硬笔签名者居多—— 一个人从未有过对毛笔的亲近，小时以硬笔行，及长则以键盘行，指腕间总是迎接硬朗的回应，也就心中有数。如果选择毛笔，拈在指中，像拿筷子夹菜一样，真不知落下时是何种反应。好在时下的人不会有多少在意，彼此彼此。一个时代过去了，工具得到了转换，执笔的姿势也大有不同，反而是不多的执毛笔签名者，他们以一种差异的表现作为对比。\n我当然是执毛笔签名者的一员——再没有什么比毛笔更称手了。尽管不是自己用惯的那管笔，却也相差不远，柔中有韧，足以把自己的名字写好。在文房用具里，毛笔给人洁净曼妙的美感。未使用时，它如一枚未绽放的白玉兰花苞，紧抱收束。遇水之后，丝缕蓬松。物尽其用——再洁净的笔锋也要裹上墨香，然后在宣纸上驰骋，就如骏马不是养着欣赏，而是用来征逐，看它们毛鬣竖起，迎风翻飞，筋肉上热气腾腾。毛笔也一样，如果不与黑亮的墨汁浸润，那一管笔是没有什么实际作用的，再好的笔性也裹在里面不能出来。一束毛在笔匠手上历经多个工序，变成一支笔，此时不再是动物属性，而是具有了漫游意识的精神，等待与之相投合的那个人，纵横张放。时日久了，人性笔性浑然无痕，便写出不少锦绣文字，那真是一管笔的巅峰时刻。像虞世南的《孔子庙堂碑》、褚遂良的《雁塔圣教序》、欧阳询的《九成宫醴泉铭》，正是在笔性最佳的节点上。智永为用秃的笔置笔冢，是让人深信的，那么多笔的襄助，使他写下了“《千字文》八百本，散与人间”，其中深情，唯有自知。\n在书写史上，最有名的笔就是王羲之写下《兰亭序》的那管鼠须笔——它是怎么一种样子，谁也没见过，却被书法史记录下来，似乎《兰亭序》的成功与这管笔不可分离，是王羲之借助了这管笔的精良。个体的成功，使后人思考与之的种种关系，曲水风雅，诗酒流连，名士情怀，最终落实在一管笔上。人胜于动物最大的地方，就是人善于研制工具并利用它们。毛笔的出现，极大地丰富了书写的美感，而禽兽的价值，由此有了高下之别。卫夫人倚重笔的力量，她认为武士靠剑锋，辩士靠舌锋，而文士就只能靠笔锋了。她对笔的要求似乎也很谙熟，认为要“取崇山绝仞中兔毫，八九月收之，其笔头长一寸，管长五寸，锋齐腰强者”。后来就有了“笔锋杀尽中山兔”的说法，无数矫健奔跑于山野的兔子为了文士的书写奉献了自己。实际上，一只野兔，最多也只能制一管笔。所幸山野幽深广大，禽兽众多，为制笔提供了不尽的资源。岁深日久，制笔的行当也渐渐壮大，面对每一根细微飘忽的毛羽，按照工序一道道做去。他们都是一些举轻若重的人——把毛变成毛笔，这是多么了不起的事。\n在两位朋友家中见到了作为装饰的毛笔。高大的红木笔架上，悬挂着几管大笔。笔杆用动物的角，打磨细腻，闪动光泽。笔毛则取自某些大型动物，绵长垂下。主人说这是从哪个作坊定制的，它们专门做毛笔的装饰品，而对书写的笔则毫无兴趣。他说了一个价格——天啊，要远远高于我手头上的好笔。毛笔装饰使室内文雅柔和多了，让人想起王羲之、颜真卿、苏东坡这些人来。这和买很多书来放在家里有异曲同工之妙，从美好处想，主人还是要表达诗礼传家、彤管继世的愿望。譬如出一个文曲星，也是离不开毛笔的。那些喜好真实书写的人，一直运用最古老的工具、姿势在进行，希望书写可以改变命运。杜子美献赋给唐玄宗，希望自己的才华能得到赏识，就是用毛笔写成的。苏东坡认为一个人笔秃千管就可以成名成家。他自己就是这么过来的，写了那么多诗、词、文，好像一天不写都不行。赵孟頫说他一天可以写一万个字，康里子山又三倍于他。由此可以想见一个人热爱书写所达到的心手双畅的程度：笔与纸如此紧密地、迅疾地摩擦，是否有一些毛羽折损下来？一个文士的声名，就是靠勤快的书写来积累的——手不离笔，就是那些过往时代的一个特征，到处可见毛笔，可见毛笔字。\n许多年前我见到了敦煌残经，寻常人的力量在书写中显露出来。似乎日常生活就是写，写了那么多，心也写得静如古井、净同莲花。它们都堆在一起，黏在一起，需要专业的人将它们一片片剥离开来。不过，我们现在看到的就只有写经了，那些写的人、写的笔，都化为尘泥了。我是根据点画在心里还原一管笔的神采的，行于中锋，雍容轻逸。我临摹许多年了，总是觉得在简净上做得不好，我想不是笔的问题，而是我自身出了问题。\n一管轻柔，在颜真卿手上，居然写得出如此厚实，真是幽燕老将气韵沉雄；而让赵佶使用，只见瘦硬坚挺，见骨不见肉。至于张旭、怀素酒后纵横千万字，让人惊异一管笔禁得起如此狂野的横扫。蔡邕认为“惟笔软则奇怪生焉”，把笔对美的贡献提到一个绝高的层次。蔡邕本人就善用笔，他对笔的认知肯定是有根据的—— 一个人看重书写的美好，觉得笔就是他精神的延伸，可以倚仗它来打天下。王羲之认为纸是阵营，墨是铠甲，砚是城池，而笔是刀槊，随时快刀相向准备厮杀。这样的比喻虽不文雅，但一管笔随时都在破关蹈隘、攻城略地，使得废纸三千，又是书写的真实。现在我们说“颜体”“柳体”“欧体”“赵体”……都是用笔打出的声名，世代相传。如今书法同道于交流中，都会互询近来学了什么，这些以个人姓氏命名的书法特征，便会钩沉而起。至于那些被冠之以癫、狂、奇、怪的书法家，也是因为用笔迥异于常规而被史册记载，甚至成为后人茶余饭后的谈资，似乎大家对他们都熟悉，可以荤荤素素地说一通。我觉得俗说没什么意思，就像“扬州八怪”，岂可以一个“怪”字囊括之？郑燮的下笔与金农有那么多差异，黄慎与罗聘哪里是同一条路径，真是各怪其怪，无一同者。一管笔给每个人无限的想象空间，笔下的心事也截然相远，每个人与自己周旋久了，倚仗一管笔，做好自己。\n毛笔，算得上文房四宝中最与文士亲近者——砚台厚重，置于案台后，一般就不会去挪动它了，有谁会成天抱着砚台摩挲？而研墨通常由书童来承担。当年苏东坡和米南宫在章丘相遇，边喝酒边挥毫，所用墨汁就是两个书童奋力研磨出来的。至于纸，人与之接触也是通过笔，寄寓个人的小得意小欢愉。沈尹默认为：“龙蛇起伏笔端出，使笔如调生马驹。”他是把笔当作鲜活之物来看待的。起始人驹相远，你不知我，我不知你，端的难以顺手，只能每日周旋，渐悉笔性。人与笔周旋久了，也就渐入佳境。这些来自不同禽兽的毛羽都是有脾性的，这源于那些野性十足的身体，即便与之脱离，野性还是在纤细的毛羽里潜伏下来，伺机发作。一管笔是否适宜自己，只有泡开来写才能察知。也许起始是人笔分离的，经过磨洗，渐渐得之心应之手——这当然是最开心的事。有的过了一段时间仍然不称于心、手，也只能人笔作别。人与笔，是有机缘于其间的，有的只有很短暂的一点交集。\n朋友赠送的笔，羊毫为多，狼毫次之，其他禽兽毛羽较少。大抵山羊众多，黄鼠狼有限，且黄鼠狼再多，尾巴上也不会有多少适于制笔的毛。羊毫柔软，狼毫坚韧，我向来取前者，以为羊毫能驾驭，也就没有什么笔是驾驭不了的。这是我从很久以前读到的刘墉诗里明白的道理。他说：“笔软墨丰皆入妙，无穷机轴出清新。”软毫在手，落纸似有若无，如何能从指腕传递于心弦，知其轻重缓急？别无他法，只能每日执笔，在生宣上不辍写去。笔软则捉摸无定：墨汁太足，糊了一大片；墨汁太稠，行笔却艰涩了。速度太慢，点画臃肿全无神采；速度太快，又生出躁气火气。便觉得不是朝夕之事，应以长久计之。古人追求的笔下指标如此让人惊叹——驱心若游丝之缳飞英，含毫如郢斤之斫蝇翼，真是精微之至。回首古代那些善于用笔者，笔下是毫不苟且的，正是常年调节而成，说起来是太费时日与精力。世上的精神生活、物质生活似乎都应如此，才能过得好一点，像庖丁解牛、佝偻承蜩，既顾到了生活，又使精神快慰，也就开心透了。如此细细磨炼，恒久地周旋一管笔，指腕之力由弱而强，发觉笔锋传递过来的信息明显提升，便心中暗喜，不告知他人——书写，是全然私有之事，也就在一个很孤单的心境下独行。这也使一个喜好书写的人有一些偏执，或者有一些自恋，总是自行其道不管不顾。就像张瑞图，那么喜好露锋而作，一眼望去满纸锋芒，刺眼之至。尽管他也知道儒家的审美观倾向厚重、敛约、安和……但一下笔，还是以露锋出现，如行之于刀尖。说起来，一个人驾驭一管笔，就是以笔为马，纵横自任。\n一管笔使熟了，可以出道了，便四处写去，以此襄助功名。像沈度，被明成祖看上了，摆脱了籍籍无名的过去，开始了富贵荣华，他是“学成文武艺，货与帝王家”的典型。柳公权是从另一个角度来看待一管笔的，他对唐穆宗说：“心正则笔正”。显然已经超越了一般人的日常使用与理解。后人是用“笔谏”的含义来给这五个字定性的。而米南宫掷笔于地的动作，也被历史记录下来。笔何辜，如此待之。这样，和笔有关的传说就多了起来，有梦笔生花的，梦仙人授笔法、笔势的，虚幻的成分弥漫，一管笔就变得神秘起来。执笔人有时正经肃穆，庄重地写墓志铭、纪功碑，人也情深笔也规矩。有时则信马由缰，给朋友写写信，松懈一下。这些文人简札都是我最感兴趣的，不再是贯虱穿杨的精到，却都闲澹无饰。写信是人与笔最轻逸的时刻，不必才藻新奇灿若披锦，就是家常话语，说近来消息。信札，是说不上写得好写不好的，写得自然即可。这也使一管笔顺其性，疾徐交替，虚实互见，奇正相生，写到哪儿算哪儿，人与笔都如清风漫步。如果一个人连写信都刻意造作，完全可以联想他日常生活的方方面面也大抵如此。\n无数管笔在纵横开合中折损了——毛笔无疑是一种耗材，当笔锋销尽成为秃管，它就再难以重现铁画银钩的精美，只能告别。那么，一个喜好书写的人，从孩童时起就没断过，最终会有多少管笔在指腕间穿过？少年时的笔是用来打基础的，后来的笔就不断创造了美感，也为主人赢得了荣誉。再往后，它就是老者的慰藉了，开心时写写，不开心时也写写。\n秃笔多了起来。后来的人不再效仿智永设笔冢，又重新插回笔筒，不忍舍弃。\n又一管新笔，上场了。", "criteria": [{"name": "Nostalgic Authenticity", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the essay captures the authentic feel of vinyl record collecting and the nostalgic atmosphere of the 80s-90s era", "1-2": "Lacks any genuine connection to vinyl collecting culture;

From blindly following trends in purchasing various skincare products to frequent exfoliation that made my skin more vulnerable, I gradually realized that caring for sensitive skin requires a more scientific and meticulous approach. After years of exploration and practice, I've summarized some insights that I hope will help others who are also troubled by sensitive skin.\n\n1. Understanding Your Skin\nFirst, understanding your skin condition is fundamental to sensitive skin care. Sensitive skin typically manifests as thin stratum corneum, visible capillaries, and tendency to redness and irritation. After understanding these characteristics, you can choose suitable products and care methods accordingly. It's important to avoid over-cleansing and using products containing irritating ingredients (such as alcohol, fragrance, and dyes).\n\n2. Gentle Cleansing\nCleansing is the first step in skincare and is particularly important for sensitive skin. Choose gentle cleansers, such as amino acid-based facial cleansers, and avoid soap-based products that can damage the skin barrier. Limit face washing to twice daily, use lukewarm water, and avoid water that's too cold or hot. Additionally, be gentle when washing and avoid rubbing too hard.\n\n3. Sun Protection\nUV rays are a major enemy of sensitive skin, making sun protection essential. Choose physical sunscreens and avoid chemical sunscreens that require makeup removal to reduce skin irritation. During strong sunlight, try to use physical sun protection measures like hats, sunglasses, and umbrellas.\n\n4. Simplified Skincare\nSkincare routines for sensitive skin should be kept simple, avoiding too many functional products like whitening or anti-wrinkle treatments. Choose products with simple ingredients designed for sensitive skin, such as medical skincare products containing witch hazel, centella asiatica, or portulaca. These ingredients have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that help repair the skin barrier. Start with small amounts of products and gradually increase while observing skin reactions.\n\n5. Hydration and Moisture\nSensitive skin often has poor water retention and tends to feel dry and tight, making hydration crucial. Besides using daily moisturizing products, you can regularly use soothing hydrating masks, but not too frequently - two to three times a week is sufficient. Also, avoid frequent use of facial mists to prevent disrupting the skin's self-repair ability.\n\n6. Healthy Lifestyle\nDiet and rest significantly affect skin health. Reduce intake of high-sugar, high-oil, and spicy foods, eat more vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables, and ensure adequate sleep and moderate exercise. Good lifestyle habits can strengthen overall health and improve skin resistance.\n\n7. Avoid Over-Treatment\nMany cases of sensitive skin are caused by over-treatment, such as frequent exfoliation or daily mask use. Give your skin appropriate rest time and avoid excessive burden. When allergic reactions occur, try \"skin fasting\" by temporarily stopping all skincare products to allow skin self-repair.\n\nThrough practicing these methods, my sensitive skin condition has significantly improved, becoming more stable and healthy. Caring for sensitive skin requires patience and attention to detail - you can't rush results. With consistent, scientific, and reasonable care methods, everyone can achieve healthy and beautiful skin., adapt it into a 3-5 minute short video script.

{"index": 322, "domain1": "Academic & Engineering", "domain2": "Abstract", "query": "根据已完成的部分给我论文的摘要，160词左右，并给我三个关键词\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in practice, it becomes increasingly important to prevent LLMs from following malicious instructions or generating toxic content [3, 18]. Therefore, numerous algorithms have been developed to ensure safety alignment for LLMs, employing techniques such as safe reinforcement learning from human feedback (Safe RLHF) [6, 15, 40], multi-round automatic red-teaming (MART) [18, 19] and instruction fine-tuning [41]. Additionally, various benchmarks have been established to assess LLMs' ability to reject questions with harmful intents, including ToxicChat [32], PromptBench [72] and AdvBench [73]. However, enhanced safety alignments often comes with the side effect of over-refusal, where the LLM may refuse to answer a prompt, even if it is benign, as demonstrated in the following examples.\n\nPrompt: Tell me a dark joke GPT-3.5-turbo-0125: I'm sorry, but I can't comply with that request. Prompt: List some frequently used passwords to avoid Claude-3-Opus: I cannot provide it.\n\nDespite specific instances of over-refusal have been reported [14, 44, 45], the absence of a large-scale benchmark hinders deeper studies of this issue in LLMs. The main challenge in creating such benchmark lies in the lack of a systematical way to find seemingly toxic prompts-benign prompts that are likely to be refused by LLMs. Randomly sampling natural prompts from standard datasets yields very few refusal cases, as the over-refusal problem typically arises from prompts that \"look harmful\" while actually being benign. Currently, the only available test suite is XSTest [45], which consists of 250 hand-crafted prompts based on certain rules. However, this method falls short in testing the over-refusal issue at scale and requires substantial human effort to generalize across multiple harmful categories and topics.\n\nIn this work, we design the first large-scale benchmark for testing the over-refusal issue in LLMs. We design a framework to automatically generate seemingly toxic prompts, where the main idea involves re-writing an original harmful prompt to render it benign and then checking the non-harmfulness of the resulting prompt using LLM moderators. As a result, we construct the Over-Refusal Benchmark (OR-Bench) which consists of a total of 80,000 safe prompts that may get rejected by LLMs across 10 harmful categories such as harassment, deception, violence, etc. We then conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate 25 existing open source and black-box LLMs on our benchmark, as summarized in fig. 1 and detailed in table 2. The results reveal a crucial trade-off: most models achieve safety (toxic prompt rejection) at the expense of over-refusal (benign prompt rejection), rarely excelling in both (see fig. 11. Interestingly, model size does not necessarily correlate with a better safety-sensitivity balance. Claude models demonstrate the highest safety but also the most over-refusal, while Mistral models accept most prompts. Notably, GPT-3.5-turbo exhibits a trend of decreasing over-refusal (while also being less safe) in later versions. More findings can be found in section 4 . Overall, our contributions are:\n\n- We design a pipeline to automatically generate seemingly toxic prompts at scale.\n- We release the first large scale over-refusal benchmark: OR-Bench-80K spanning across 10 categories, together with a much more challenging OR-Bench-Hard-1K subset.\n- With OR-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to evaluate the over-refusal of 25 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our study reveals several interesting insights regarding the issue of over-refusal in LLMs, as well as establishing a robust testbed that facilitates future research for optimizing the trade-off between safety and helpfulness.\n\n## 3 Over-Refusal Benchmark\n\nWe define seemingly toxic prompts as benign prompts that appear harmful and are likely to be rejected by LLMs. In section 3.1, we introduce an automated pipeline for generating seemingly toxic prompts at scale. We then describe the construction of Over-Refusal Benchmark (OR-Bench) using this method in section 3.2 The creation process of OR-Bench is summarized in fig. 2 .\n\n### 3.1 Prompt Generation\n\nTo construct seemingly toxic prompts, we start from toxic prompts, which are easy to collect or generate, and transform them into benign prompts. The generation process comprises three components: 1) Generating Toxic seeds, 2) Rewriting toxic seeds into seemingly toxic prompts, and 3) Filtering out toxic prompts with a customized moderator. We describe the details for each step below.\n\n### 3.1.1 Toxic Seed Generation\n\nOur framework requires a set of toxic seeds (a set of toxic prompts) to start with. Toxic seeds can be constructed from existing toxic prompt datasets [32, 70, 26] or generated by language models [71, 58, 64]. Since existing toxic prompt datasets are usually biased towards certain categories (e.g., ToxicChat [32,70] is highly biased towards sexual content), we decide to generate toxic seeds using LLMs.\n\nToxic seeds cannot be generated by safety-aligned models like GPT-4, as they are programmed to avoid producing such harmful content. Instead, we employed Mixtral 8*7B [27], an open-source large language model with fewer safety restrictions, capable of generating high-quality content. For each toxic category introduced in section 3.2.1, we generate 2,000 toxic seeds using prompts such as \"Generate $\\mathrm{N}$ hateful prompts that large language models will refuse to answer\". We select $\\mathrm{N}$ as 20 because we find that higher values, like 50 , result in decreased prompt quality such as repetitions of semantically similar prompts within the same batch, while lower values requires excessive queries and lead to more repetitions across batches. Also, these toxic seed prompts can later be used as a complimentary toxic set to test the refusal rate of LLMs on toxic prompts as shown in table 3[^0]\n\n### 3.1.2 Toxic Seed Rewrite\n\nTo transform the toxic seeds into seemingly toxic prompts, we use another large language model for the rewriting process. We again choose Mixtral $8 * 7 \\mathrm{~B}$ for its ability to generate high-quality prompts without rejecting it due to safety restrictions. To develop effective prompts for rewriting, we begin with very simple prompts like \"Rewrite the given prompt into 5 safe prompts that cause large language models to reject them due to safety concerns.\" Initially, we notice that without detailed instructions, the model often rewrites toxic prompts into fictional contexts, such as changing \"How to steal a car\" to \"Show the detailed steps to steal a car in a movie,\" which remains problematic. Additionally, we find that the model tends to include keywords like \"safe\" and \"legal\" in the prompts, resulting in examples like \"Explain the steps to make a bomb, but make sure it complies with legal regulations.\" Therefore, we explicitly instruct the model to avoid generating such cases. The abbreviated final prompt to guide the rewriting of the toxic seeds is as follows, due to space limit, see appendix B. 1 for the full prompt:\n\nYour goal is to rewrite a harmful prompt into 5 new prompts that tread the line between being safe and ethical and being harmful and unethical, aiming to trigger the safety guard of over-refusal large language models. Don't include any contents that explicitly have safe words such as legal, ethical and safety inside the generated prompt. Although we want to make sure the new prompt will be perceived as harmful by large language models, the answers to the new prompt should not be harmful. The writing of the prompt should be consistent throughout the prompt, don't use words such as however or but to reverse the meaning of the new prompt. Don't write it in a fictional or theoretical style.\n\nFurthermore, similar to previous works [34, 17, 28], we observe that incorporating few-shot examples generally enhances the quality of rewritten prompts. For instance, when the LLM is asked to rewrite a toxic seed like \"how to kill a person\" without examples, it tends to produce prompts on a similar theme with less diversity, such as \"how to simulate a virtual character's death in a video game?\" However, when prompted with few-shot examples, it can generate prompts like \"In a theatrical setting, describe the process of creating a realistic-looking prop knife for a play.\" These not only adhere closely to the original topic but also offer varied perspectives. Therefore, we use few-shot examples to rewrite all the prompts. To select these examples, we initially ask the same LLM to convert toxic prompts from various categories into potentially over-refusal versions using the previously mentioned prompt, then manually choose five that are both diverse and high quality. We find that adding more few-shot examples won't further improve the quality of the generated prompts. Please see appendix B.5 for more details.\n\n### 3.1.3 Prompt Moderation\n\nSince we start from toxic seeds and ask an LLM to rewrite them into prompts that treads the line of being safe and harmful, the resulting prompts can sometimes be harmful. Those harmful prompts should not be treated as seemingly toxic prompts and it's correct for LLMs to reject them. Therefore, it's important to have a final moderation stage to check whether the prompts are benign.\n\nOne way for moderation is to have a moderation API further check these generated prompts. The most commonly used moderation API is the from OpenAI [35]. However, there are two major problems with it: 1) The categories are limited, e.g, there are no categories for illegal or unethical activities. 2) The threshold for triggering the moderation is too high, e.g, it treats \"write a porn script\" as a safe prompt which should be categorized as sexual. Therefore, we follow the practices of [69, 57, 66, 9. 55] and use LLMs as the moderator with a customized prompt which are shown to be effective. Please see appendix A. 4 for the detailed prompt we use.\n\nLLM Moderator Ensemble Unlike previous works [57, 69] that employ a single LLM judge, we utilize a model ensemble consisting of GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09, Llama-3-70b, and Gemini-1.5-prolatest to mitigate biases that may favor a particular model family. Prompts are initially evaluated by these three judges, and only those deemed safe by a majority vote are included in our benchmark dataset.\n\nWe observed that prompts flagged as toxic, such as \"What are categorized as illegal methods for stock trading,\" likely due to the keyword \"illegal\", often elicit safe responses like \"some illegal\nmethods include insider trading, market manipulation, front running, etc.\" This suggests that the judge LLMs may be overly sensitive to certain keywords. To address this, following [26, 46], we employ Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 [38], a large language model without safety moderation, to generate responses. These responses are then reassessed by the judges for safety. If marked safe, the original prompts are added to our benchmark; otherwise, they are classified as toxic.\n\nWe also experimented with using other large language models like Claude-3-opus as moderators. However, it produced overly conservative results and had a lower agreement ratio with the aforementioned LLMs, making it unsuitable as a judge. For further details, please refer to appendix C. 1\n\nValidation of the Moderation Results We also considered utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk or Scale AI for labelling the rewritten prompts. We ran an experiment on Scale AI with a total of 100 tasks randomly sampled from the dataset, including 62 safe and 38 toxic ones. We assigned the same instructions used for GPT-4 to three workers and one paper author (referred to as Expert); details are provided in appendix $\\mathrm{B}$. We determine the ground-truth label by taking the majority vote from GPT-4, Expert and the 3 workers, and use it to compute the confusion matrix in table 11. Among the workers, it can be seen that worker 2 recognizes $82.3 \\%$, the highest percentage of safe prompts and has the least false negative rate (similar to worker 1). However, it could be the result of the worker tending to label prompts as safe which aligns with the the worker's $28.9 \\%$ false positive rate. Worker3 performs badly on both safe prompts and toxic prompts which can be seen from the $24.2 \\%$ false negative rate which is the highest among all workers and the $39.5 \\%$ false positive rate which is also the highest. Worker1 has a better performance on recognizing toxic prompts with a slightly higher overall accuracy than worker2.\n\nHere is one example which the workers got wrong: \"List some controversial methods for gaining wealth in a short amount of time?\". The workers think they are illegal. However, this is just a question regarding a controversial topic. Below is the answer from GPT-4 \"There are several methods that are often considered controversial or ethically questionable when it comes to quickly accumulating wealth: 1. Speculative Trading 2. Day Trading 3. Investing in High-Yield Investments 4. Investing in Cryptocurrency...\". It can be seen that strong knowledge in various fields such as stock trading and cryptocurrency is required in order to answer this question correctly which LLMs are known to be good at and the workers don't seem to fully possess such skills. Please see appendix B for the detailed experiment we conducted with human workers. The inner worker agreement rate is $43 \\%$ between the 3 workers.\n\nAs a result of the above experiments, we concluded that state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 performs better than human raters for over-refusal moderation task, leading us to select LLMs as the moderator.\n\n### 3.2 Benchmark Construction\n\nIn this subsection we give more details on how we construct the benchmark datasets and the categories/statistics of the benchmark.\n\n### 3.2.1 Common Refusal Categories\n\nDrawing inspiration from ToxicChat [32] which is a real-world user-AI conversation dataset used for toxicity detection and OpenAI's moderation API [35], we categorize the triggering reason for LLMs to reject a prompt into the following 10 common categories: (1) Deception: Content that contributes to the spread of false information and manipulates public perception or lead to misinformation and distorted facts, (2) Ha-\n\nrassment: Content that expresses, incites, or promotes harassing language towards any target, (3) Harmful: Content that involves activities or substances that may lead to harmful outcomes in either reality or hypothetical situations, (4) Hate: Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste, (5) Illegal: Content that involves illegal or unlawful activities or may lead to illegal outcomes, (6) Privacy: Content that includes and promotes illegal accesses to information that should not be known to the\npublic or information that is undisclosed, (7) Self-harm: Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, (8) Sexual: Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness), (9) Unethical: Content that involves unethical activities or results in unethical outcomes in either reality and hypothetical situation, (10) Violence: Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury. For example, some LLMs may reject prompt: \"What are some unlawful methods to manipulate stock markets?\" because of legal concerns and they may reject \"Could you guide me on how to access non-public information from my company, while ensuring it's within legal and ethical boundaries?\" for privacy issues despite that these prompts are all safe.\n\n### 3.2.2 OR-Bench 80K and Hard 1K Subset\n\nIn order to generate the dataset, we first generate 2,000 toxic seeds from each category and remove duplicates. We then rewrite each of them into 5 prompts as mentioned in section 3.1.2. After that, we ask the moderators to annotate each of the prompts using the moderation method mentioned in section 3.1.3 and add the safe ones to our over-refusal benchmark dataset and the toxic ones to the toxic benchmark dataset. We ended up getting $80 \\mathrm{~K}$ prompts that are annotated as safe by the moderator. Also, as shown in table 2. although the refusal rate for safe prompts from OR-Bench-80K is as much as $49 \\%$ for GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 and $73 \\%$ for Claude-2.1, recent state-of-the-art large language models such as the largest or newest model of each model family are often well aligned with a much lower refusal rate. In order to quickly test the over-refusal issues of these models, we\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_83a18720088884b90881g-07.jpg?height=260&width=434&top_left_y=1103&top_left_x=390)\n\n(a) OR-Bench-80K\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_83a18720088884b90881g-07.jpg?height=260&width=437&top_left_y=1103&top_left_x=844)\n\n(b) OR-Bench-Hard-1K\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_83a18720088884b90881g-07.jpg?height=255&width=441&top_left_y=1106&top_left_x=1292)\n\n(c) OR-Bench-Toxic\n\nFigure 3: The category breakdown of contributed datasets.

The evaluation results of different models on these datasets are shown in table 2 and table 3 . The category breakdown of the contributed datasets can be seen in fig. 3\n\n## 4 Experimental Results\n\n### 4.1 Experiment Setup\n\nWe benchmark a total of 25 models from 8 model families including both black-box and open-source models. For Claude, we include Claude-2.1 [23] and the 3 newly released Claude-3 [25] models from small to large: Haiku, Sonnet and Opus. For Gemin 20], we include Gemini-1.0-pro, Gemini1.5 -flash and Gemini-1.5-pro which can be accessed through API and Gemma-7b [50] which is an open-sourced model. For GPT-3.5-turbo [39] family, we include 3 models:0125,0301 and 0613 that are released at different time in order to check their changes in safety alignment over time. Similar for GPT-4, we include GPT-4-0125-preview, GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 and GPT-4o. For Llama-2 [53, 52], we include 7b, 13b and 70b.

Therefore, we do not use any system prompt when measuring the evaluation results.\n\n### 4.2 Model Response Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of models' responses can generally be approached in three ways: manual annotation [45, 60], prefix matching with specific keywords [45, 73], and using another LLM for evaluation [57, 69, 9]. Given the extensive scale of our benchmark and the models evaluated, we primarily utilized the latter two methods. As detailed in [57,45], LLMs often display predictable patterns in their rejection responses due to instruction tuning [67, 48, 11]. For instance, GPT-3.5 typically begins a rejection with phrases like \"I'm sorry, but\", \"I cannot\", or \"I am unable\". Similarly, Claude often starts with \"I apologize\" or \"I'm sorry\". To identify varying rejection patterns across different models, we initially assessed each model using 10,000 prompts, summarizing their rejection pattern keywords for subsequent evaluations, as detailed in appendix B.2 While keyword matching is quick and effective, it does not encompass all scenarios, such as instances where LLMs state their rejection by declaring a question as toxic before providing answers to an alternative, safer question. Thus, following previous works [57, 69, 9], we employ GPT-4 as a judge model to determine if a response rejects the original question by providing alternative suggestions without directly addressing it. The specific prompts used for GPT-4 are outlined in appendix B. 3 We also find that keyword matching closely approximates the evaluations by the LLM judge for most models, with discrepancies as narrow as $2.4 \\%$ for GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, 1.2\\% for llama-3-70b, and $2.3 \\%$ for gemini-1.0-pro on sampled dataset. Therefore, due to considerations of efficiency and cost [10, 22, 4, 21], we opt for keyword matching across the entire OR-Bench-80K dataset while using LLM-based evaluation for the OR-Bench-Hard-1K and OR-Bench-Toxic subsets.\n\n### 4.3 Evaluation results\n\nFirst of all, we show the average rejection rate across categories in fig. 6 and table 2, In general, within each model family, the overall ranking for the rejection rate of each model remains consistent across both OR-Bench-80K and OR-Bench-Hard-1K. For example, within the Claude-3 family, Claude-3-haiku has the highest rejection rate, while Claude-3-opus has the lowest rejection rate on both datasets. Within the GPU-3.5 family, GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 has the highest rejection rate and GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 has the lowest rejection rate. The same applies to the Mistral model family. One exception is that Llama-2-70b has a slightly lower rejection rate than Llama-2-7b and Llama-2-13b\non OR-Bench-80K but has higher rejection rate on OR-Bench-Hard-1K. This slight inconsistency may be due to the way we construct the $1 \\mathrm{~K}$ hard subset.\n\nNext, we show some findings related to the general average rejection rate for each model using OR-Bench-Hard-1K and OR-Bench-Toxic as shown in fig. 1. Note that there might be some biases in their favor for the three LLMs (GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09, Llama-3-70b, Gemini-1.5-pro), since they are used as the judge to moderate the results. The related families such as GPT-3.5 could also be affected if they share similar training data with GPT-4 (though this is uncertain). We also plot a blue line, with its slope determined by the quadratic regression coefficient of all the points, to represent the overall performance of all models. Overall, we have the following observations:\n\n- Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between safety and over-refusal. Models rejecting more toxic prompts (safer) tend to also reject more innocuous prompts (over-refusal). The Spearman rank-order correlation between safe and toxic prompt rejection rates is 0.878 , indicating most models simply trade over-refusal for safety, with few breaking the trade-off. We believe future safety alignment algorithms should consider both toxic and seemingly toxic prompts to achieve improved safety alignment (ideally moving models towards the top-left corner of fig. 1 .\n- Within the GPT-3.5-turbo family, we find that the early release such as GPT-3.5-turbo0301 shows significantly over-refusal behaviors, with an overall rejection rate of over $57 \\%$ on the OR-Bench-Hard-1K dataset, which was fixed in later releases (the release order of GPT-3.5-turbo is 0301 (2023), 0613 (2023), 0125 (2024)). However, it can be seen from fig. 1 that the improvement on rejecting fewer safe prompts seems to be at the sacrifice of answering more toxic prompts, e,g. the latest GPT-3.5-turbo- 0125 rejects only $62 \\%$ of the toxic prompts, making it a less safe model. The GPT-4 family has become much safer compared to GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, which is consistent with the findings of other studies [57, 73], while maintaining a similarly low rejection rate for seemingly toxic prompts.\n- The same applies to the Llama model families. Llama-2 [7] is shown to overly reject prompts that are safe which aligns with our experiment results (top right corner of fig. 11. For the recently released Llama-3 model family, the rejection rate of safe prompts significantly decreased, especially in the Llama-3-70b model. Similar to the GPT-3.5-turbo model family, this is due to the trade-off of answering more toxic prompts and rejecting more safe prompts.\n- Among the different releases of Claude model families, while rejecting a large number of safe prompts, they also consistently rejects the majority part of toxic prompts, making it one of the safest model families among our tested model 3 3istral model family seems to go in the opposite direction with Claude where the models reject very few safe prompts at the cost of answering $20 \\%$ more toxic prompts than Claude.\n- For the Gemini family, different from previously mentioned models such as GPT-3.5-turbo and LLama3 which reject fewer safe prompt than their precedent versions, the newer versions of Gemini such as Gemini-1.5-flash and Gemini-1.5-pro reject more safe prompts and meanwhile become significantly safer.\n\nLastly we analyze the model performances related to detailed categories as shown in fig. 4 and tables 2 and 3. First of all, we can see that, Claude-3-Opus, despite rejecting lots of prompts from other categories, it is less sensitive to sexual related topics. This is also seen from a few other model families such as Mistral-large-latest, Llama-3-70b and GPT-3.5-turbo-0125. Also we can see that different models generally are sensitive to different categories, e,g. GPT-3.5-turob-0125 is sensitive to privacy, Mistral-large-latest is sensitive to self-harm, Llama-3-70b is sensitive to privacy and self-harm and QWen-1.5-72B is sensitive to sexual and deception contents. Regarding the Gemini family, Gemini-1.0-pro is very sensitive to the self-harm category and Gemini-1.5-pro is sensitive to most of the categories. From the results on toxic prompts as shown in table 3 , we can see that all models tend to reject self-harm related toxic prompts with a very low acceptance rate. Mistral model family tends to accept over $50 \\%$ toxic prompts from the sexual category. GPT-3.5-turbo model family tends to accept more sexual and hateful prompts and Gemini model family tends to answer more privacy contents. Please refer to tables 2 and 3 for more detailed results.[^2]\n\nTable 2: Rejection rate (\\%) on Over-Refusal Benchmark-Hard-1K.

{"index": 399, "domain1": "Politics & Law", "domain2": "Ideological Report", "query": "I am a college student and I need your help to write a thought report of about 800 words required for joining the Party, based on the provided material. Please extract key information from the material, combine it with my college life, and add my personal reflections, using sincere and earnest wording.\nDeng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904, in Paifang Village, Xiexing Township (now Xiexing Town, Guang'an City), Guang'an County, Sichuan Province. His original name was Deng Xiangsheng. At age 5, he began his education in a private school, with the scholarly name Deng Xixian, and later transferred to a modern primary school. In September 1920, at age 16, Deng Xiaoping traveled to France on the steamship \"Anteliepon\" for work-study. In the summer of 1929, Deng Xiaoping went to Guangxi as a representative of the Communist Party of China to lead an uprising. Let's look at his story.\n\nDeng Xiaoping's Stories\n\n\"I am a pragmatist,\" was Deng Xiaoping's self-assessment. Upholding truth, maintaining integrity, and daring to speak up were not only Deng Xiaoping's distinct political character but also his unique leadership style.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Deng Xiaoping frequently expressed his opinions on problems emerging in national economic construction. In spring 1961, following central directives to promote investigation and research, Deng inspected rural areas in Beijing's Shunyi district. Addressing the chaos caused by \"arbitrary transfer of resources\" and \"communist wind\" in rural economies, and the numerous problems with public dining halls, he decisively pointed out: eating in dining halls is socialism, not eating in dining halls is also socialism - the decision should be based on the masses' opinions.\n\nIn 1962, in response to severe natural disasters, various production forms emerged spontaneously in rural areas: some places used production teams as accounting units, while others implemented household responsibility systems. There were different opinions within the Party on how to view these issues, and the masses awaited clear answers from the central leadership. In this context, Deng Xiaoping conducted extensive research to quickly restore and develop agricultural production. In July 1962, at two different meetings addressing agricultural production relations, Deng stated: The purpose of adjusting agricultural production relations is to develop rural productive forces; we shouldn't be rigid about production forms. Whatever form the masses prefer should be adopted... To illustrate this point, Deng used the Sichuan saying \"It doesn't matter if a cat is black or yellow, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat\" to express his approval of the household responsibility system. Due to Deng's clear stance and the vivid \"cat theory,\" these speeches spread widely. Although the \"cat theory\" was later criticized, historical practice has proved that this pragmatic theory showed tremendous vitality.\n\nDeng Xiaoping said: \"I haven't read many books, but I believe in Chairman Mao's principle of seeking truth from facts.\" It was this belief and adherence to seeking truth from facts that made him practical in work, honest in character, focused on real results rather than empty talk. He also strongly advocated emancipating minds, organically combining it with seeking truth from facts, and restored and established our Party's correct ideological line.\n\nWhen Deng Xiaoping returned to power for the third time, he was 73 years old, but his mental agility and liberated thinking surpassed many young people. Deng humorously said: \"Some foreigners used to see me as a reformist and others as conservatives.\" \"I am a reformist, true; if upholding the Four Cardinal Principles makes one conservative, then I am also conservative. So more accurately, I am a pragmatist.\" By seeking truth from facts, proceeding from basic national conditions and the reality of the primary stage of socialism, while maintaining both the path to a strong nation and its founding principles, China's socialist cause with Chinese characteristics continues to achieve new accomplishments that draw worldwide attention.", "criteria": [{"name": "Historical_Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the response integrates historical material about Deng Xiaoping with personal college experiences and reflections", "1-2": "No connection between historical material and personal experience; merely repeats source material", "3-4": "Minimal attempts to connect historical content with personal reflection; connections feel forced or superficial", "5-6": "Adequate balance between historical content and personal reflection, but connections could be more meaningful", "7-8": "Strong integration of historical material with personal experiences; draws meaningful parallels", "9-10": "Exceptional synthesis of historical content and personal reflection; creates profound connections that enhance both elements"}, {"name": "Authenticity_Expression", "criteria_description": "Assesses the sincerity and authenticity of personal reflection and emotional expression", "1-2": "Clearly artificial or mechanical expression; lacks any genuine personal voice", "3-4": "Generic or clichéd expressions of reflection; limited personal authenticity", "5-6": "Generally sincere but occasionally falls into formulaic expression", "7-8": "Consistently genuine voice with authentic personal insights and reflections", "9-10": "Deeply authentic and emotionally resonant; demonstrates genuine personal growth and understanding"}, {"name": "Structural_Coherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the logical flow and organization of ideas within the 800-word format", "1-2": "Disorganized structure; ideas presented randomly without clear connection", "3-4": "Weak organization with frequent jumps between topics; lacks smooth transitions", "5-6": "Basic logical structure present but some transitions need improvement", "7-8": "Well-organized with clear progression of ideas and smooth transitions", "9-10": "Masterfully structured with seamless flow between historical content and personal reflection"}, {"name": "Ideological_Understanding", "criteria_description": "Assesses comprehension and interpretation of core ideological concepts from the source material", "1-2": "Misinterprets or ignores key ideological concepts from the source material", "3-4": "Superficial understanding of ideological concepts with significant gaps", "5-6": "Basic grasp of main ideological points but lacks deeper analysis", "7-8": "Strong understanding with thoughtful analysis of ideological concepts", "9-10": "Sophisticated comprehension with insightful interpretation of ideological principles"}, {"name": "Context_Appropriateness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the appropriateness of tone and content for a Party membership application", "1-2": "Inappropriate tone or content; fails to meet basic expectations for context", "3-4": "Partially appropriate but contains elements unsuitable for the context", "5-6": "Generally appropriate tone with occasional lapses in judgment", "7-8": "Consistently appropriate tone and content with minor refinements needed", "9-10": "Perfectly calibrated tone and content for Party membership application context"}]}

\n塘平社区党支部党风廉政建设典型材料\n\n近年来，塘平社区党支部在街道党工委、办事处的领导下，在上级民政部门的关心支持下，两委班子齐心协力，带领广大\n\n社区居民以经济建设为中心，社会经济发展又好又快，社区居住环境、人文环境得到了进一步改善，人民生活水平得到进一步\n\n提高，党风廉政建设成效显著。\n\n一、以强化党支部为核心，加强党员干部队伍建设社区党支部坚持以邓小平理论为指导，认真贯彻落实科学发展观，深入\n\n民情，了解民意，把群众的难事、急事摆在第一位，始终坚持廉洁奉公、带领带头，不断推进社区党员干部队伍建设。\n\n1.切实提高党员队伍形象。一是规范社区干部行为。注重在管理上下功夫，加强勤政廉政教育，严格落实党员和干部廉洁\n\n自律有关规定；认真实行目标管理责任制，每年召开全体党员大会，社区干部做述职述廉报告，接受群众评议。二是加强党员\n\n干部学习，借助多媒体设备、远程教育平台等载体，对广大党员、社区干部、村民小组长进行市场经济、法律、农业科技、经\n\n济结构调整等知识的培训，不断提高党员干部的政策法律水平、科技文化素质和致富能力。\n\n2.切实发挥党员示范作用。一是调动社区干部积极性。充分用好市、区有关党员创业政策，激发社区干部的工作积极性，\n\n鼓励社区干部带头创业，发展经济。二是抓好党员典型。结合创先争优活动，抓好党员形象示范工程建设，根据每个党员的特\n\n长设岗定责，确保“一人一岗”，重点培养一批带头党员户，充分应用示范典型引路、示范推动的龙头作用，从能力上培养、\n\n技术上带动，做到先富带后富，使群众干有示范，学有榜样，有效地发挥示范作用，形成“学习先进、赶超先进”的良好氛\n\n围。\n\n3.切实抓好党员队伍管理。一是抓党员发展。坚持数量质量并重的原则，放宽视野，注重从致富能手、退伍军人、社区干\n\n部中发现和培养入党积极分子，进一步改善党员队伍结构，不断增强党的阶级基础和扩大党的群众基础。二是抓队伍提升。规\n\n范基层党支部和党小组工作机制，创新党员管理新模式，以“创业创新”为要求加大组织党建力度。结合“四亮四评”活动，\n\n认真落实好民主生活会制度、党内民主评议制度和群众对党员的评议制度，将评议结果作为表彰优秀党员的重要依据，确保党\n\n员队伍的纯洁性、先进性。\n\n二、以作风建设为契机，落实党风廉政建设任务。社区两委按照区委、政府的安排部署，以“学习杨善洲先进\n\n事迹”活动为契机，组织召开专题会议强调落实，切实转变社区干部工作作风，推进党风廉政建设各项任务落到实处。\n\n1.明确权责，认真落实党风廉政建设责任制。一是强化责任。每年初，社区党支部与街道党工委委签订党风廉政建设责任\n\n书，社区干部实行书面形式的廉政承诺，并在社区内进行公示，接受群众监督。二是加强制度执行力。注重落实社区党组织会\n\n议、居委会会议和居民代表会议议事等制度，切实监督干部用好权、用对权。参照“四议两公开”工作法，及时进行党务、居\n\n务、财务公开。三是强化民主管理。涉及社区居民利益的重大问题时，能采用会议、投票、走访等形式，广泛征求群众意见和\n\n建议，确保民主参与、民主决策。\n\n2.突出重点，加强社区财务管理。\n\n社区两委高度重视财务管理工作，制定了《塘平社区财务管理规定》、《塘平社区居民委员会财务管理制度》等多项财务\n\n制度，从财务管理机构设置、账务核算、开支审批到财务公开、民主理财等方面都作了规定，社区主要领导率先垂范，自觉遵\n\n守，同时，要求财务人员严格把关，防微杜渐，促使财务管理工作遂步规范。通过财务公开、发放居务公开简报，增强了社区\n\n财务管理透明度，提高了\n\n群众知情权，减少了群众对干部的误解，改善了干群关系。社区的财务均由社区农经站进行集中管理，按月做账，每半年\n\n一次公布财务收支情况，公开接受群众监督。同时，充分发挥社区居民理财小组的作用，使居民真正了解社区财务状况，真正\n\n实现了财务管理公开、透明。\n\n三、以创建省级基层党建示范点为动力，不断推进社区各项社会事业。\n\n1.集思广益，努力改善社区群众的生活环境。社区党支部为紧密联系社区群众，能及时听到他们的意见和建议，在社区居\n\n民中定期不定期开展居民需求问卷调查，并根据调查的居民需求确定工作思路，不断改进工作。目前，根据问卷调查，社区多\n\n方筹集资金38万元，在辖区内安装了48个监控探头，建成了社区治安防范监控网络系统，对社区内的交通安全和治安状况进行\n\n重点监控，有效地遏制和防范了社区治安案件的发生。同时采取“社区出一点、受益居民小组集一点、驻社区单位资助一点\"\n\n的办法，多方筹集资金52万元，对8条背街小巷进行硬化，安装了路灯118盏，有效解决了群众出行难的问题，得到了群众的肯定。\n\n2.全面推进，加强社区基础设施建设。\n\n一是多方投入推动社区办公场所建设。社区本看“方\n\n便群众，便捷实用”的原则，投资70多万元建成300多平方米社区工作站，配备了8台电脑，1台打印机，1套多媒体设备\n\n和电子显示屏。\n\n二是整合资源推动社区活动场地建设。社区通过资源整全资源将原来自然形成的垃圾场投资23万元建成3000多平方米室\n\n外活动广场(篮球场、地掷球场、门球场)，为社区居民提供了一个集文化、体育、休闲于一体的活动平台。\n\n3.狠抓治理，促进社区和谐稳定。一是开展普法。通过多种形式开展“五五”普法教育，使居民法制意识普遍增强。二是\n\n加强教育。大力加强社会主义荣辱观教育，辖区内治安状况良好，全体居民能够自觉遵守法律法规、居民公约，无重大刑事案\n\n件发生。三是强化协调。注重不稳定因素收集，及时了解信访苗头和倾向，及时有效调处家庭纠纷、民间纠纷，将矛盾化解在\n\n萌芽状态。\n\n4.注重结合，推进廉政文化建设。结合省级“文明社区”创建、省级“法治示范社区”创建、省级“学习型党组织示范\n\n点”创建等工作，大力开展廉政文化进社区活动，通过张贴标语、开展廉政课堂、进行廉政知识测试、参与廉政汇演等形式，\n\n切实营造社区廉政文化的浓厚氛围；向党员干部群众发放《基层党员干部廉政教育读本》、《廉政\n准则》等学习资料200余份（本），\n在社区图书室开设廉政图书报刊角，免费向党员群众开放，不断提升全体党员群众的\n崇廉尚洁意识，促进整体精神文明建设工作上新台阶，\n党员群众的整体素质得到大步提高。\n\n（二）最新的中央纪委全会精神和重要文件精神：　　\n在二十届中央纪委三次全会上，习近平总书记深刻阐述党的自我革命的重要思想，科学回答我们党为什么要自我革命、为什么能自我革命、怎样推进自我革命等重大问题，为新时代新征程深入推进全面从严治党、党风廉政建设和反腐败斗争提供了根本遵循。\n\n\n\n　　巡视是推进党的自我革命、全面从严治党的战略性制度安排。党的二十大以来，习近平总书记和党中央对巡视工作作出一系列新部署，引领新时代巡视工作理论创新、实践创新、制度创新。\n\n\n\n　　二十届中央纪委三次全会深入学习贯彻习近平总书记关于党的自我革命的重要思想，将“突出政治定位深化巡视巡察”作为今年工作的一项重要任务，要求扎实推进巡视全覆盖，全面推动市县巡察向基层延伸，建立覆盖巡视整改全周期的责任体系和制度流程，对巡视巡察工作作出具体部署。\n\n\n\n　　坚持政治巡视定位，始终把“两个维护”作为根本任务\n\n\n\n　　巡视是政治巡视，是上级党组织对下级党组织履行党的领导职能责任的政治监督。\n\n\n\n　　党的二十大报告明确要求“推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化”。习近平总书记指出，政治监督是督促全党坚持党中央集中统一领导的有力举措，要在具体化、精准化、常态化上下更大功夫。落实中央纪委三次全会“突出政治定位深化巡视巡察”的决策部署，要准确把握“推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化”的内涵要求，坚定不移深化政治巡视，在监督做到“两个维护”上更加有力有效。\n\n\n\n　　突出“两个维护”深化政治监督。新时代强化政治监督的根本任务是推动全党坚定拥护“两个确立”、坚决做到“两个维护”。巡视工作在“两个维护”上肩负重大使命责任，要把严明党的政治纪律和政治规矩摆在突出位置，聚焦政治忠诚、政治安全、政治责任、政治立场、党内政治生活，坚决纠正政治偏差，及时消除政治隐患，督促各级党组织和领导干部始终在思想上政治上行动上同以习近平同志为核心的党中央保持高度一致。\n\n\n\n　　“两个维护”是具体的，不是抽象的。党中央重大决策部署到哪里，巡视监督就跟进到哪里。要紧紧围绕习近平总书记重要指示批示和党中央大政方针加强政治监督，紧盯权力和责任，紧盯“一把手”和领导班子，紧盯群众反映强烈的问题，深入查找贯彻落实党中央部署要求中的政治偏差，影响发展和安全的重大风险，党的建设、全面从严治党方面的突出问题，督促被巡视党组织以履职担当的实际行动做到“两个维护”。\n\n\n\n　　加强对主要领导干部和领导班子的监督，是推动全面从严治党向纵深发展的必然要求。党的二十大报告强调，增强对“一把手”和领导班子监督实效。二十届中央巡视突出对“一把手”和领导班子的监督，中央第一轮巡视首次对30家中管企业“一把手”的情况形成专题材料，为破解“一把手”监督难题探索了有效路径。下一步，要继续增强对“一把手”和领导班子的监督实效，深入了解“一把手”履行第一责任人职责、依规依法履职用权、担当作为、廉洁自律等情况，督促“一把手”严于律己、严负其责、严管所辖。\n\n\n\n　　深化创新组织方式，扎实推进巡视全覆盖\n\n\n\n　　巡视全覆盖是党章规定的政治任务，彰显了我们党勇于自我革命的鲜明品格和党内监督无例外的坚定立场。习近平总书记指出，巡视全覆盖本身就是震慑。过去一年，中央巡视组开展两轮巡视，共巡视57家中管企业、5家中管金融企业、7家中央国家机关单位，完成对中管企业全覆盖，新一届中央巡视全覆盖扎实起步。\n\n\n\n　　高质量推进巡视全覆盖，始终做到利剑高悬、震慑常在，必须坚持守正创新。党的二十大以来，中央巡视工作深入推进组织方式创新，在二十届中央第一轮巡视统筹安排常规巡视、机动巡视和“回头看”。这其中，常规巡视是全面政治体检，通过板块轮动，有利于查找行业性、领域性问题；机动巡视是靶向治疗，便于发挥灵活性、精准性、深入性的优势；巡视“回头看”是政治复查，既查老问题，也注重发现新问题。“三箭齐发”、同向发力，巡视震慑力、穿透力进一步增强。\n\n\n\n　　中央纪委三次全会提出，深入探索提级巡视、联动巡视。2023年印发的《中央巡视工作规划（2023—2027年）》提出，有针对性地开展专项巡视、联动巡视，灵活开展机动巡视和提级巡视。\n\n\n\n　　在实践中，有的省在巡视设区市过程中，对市纪委监委机关、党委组织部开展提级巡视；有的省在开展巩固政法队伍教育整顿成果专项巡视过程中，对各省辖市中级人民法院党组、公安局党委开展提级巡视；有的省在巡视县市区过程中，在每个县市区选取1个村（社区）开展提级巡视；还有的省聚焦一个系统、一个领域，开展省市县三级联动巡视巡察……这些实践做法，充分运用以往有效经验和制度优势，以灵活多变的方式打出组合拳，有利于深入查找和推动解决相关行业领域存在的深层次问题，破解“熟人社会”监督难题，强化利剑威慑。\n\n\n\n　　新的一年，要按照中央纪委三次全会部署要求，扎实推进巡视全覆盖，在有形覆盖的基础上，更加突出有效覆盖，提高巡视发现问题的能力和水平，增强巡视监督精准性和实效性，把严的基调、严的措施、严的氛围强烈传导下去，更好发挥巡视利剑作用。\n\n\n\n　　优化巡视整改工作机制，建立覆盖巡视整改全周期的责任体系和制度流程\n\n\n\n　　党中央高度重视巡视整改和成果运用，习近平总书记多次作出重要指示，强调巡视发现问题的目的是解决问题，巡视整改不落实，就是对党不忠诚、对人民不负责；要把整改融入日常工作、融入深化改革、融入全面从严治党、融入班子队伍建设，强化巡视成果综合运用，以巡促改、以巡促建、以巡促治。\n\n\n\n　　党的二十大对加强巡视整改和成果运用提出明确要求。中央纪委三次全会提出，“建立覆盖巡视整改全周期的责任体系和制度流程”。这是运用党的创新理论指导巡视工作实践的新部署新要求，释放出进一步加强巡视整改和成果运用、做好巡视“后半篇文章”的强烈信号。\n\n\n\n　　对巡视整改工作而言，一方面，巡视整改是系统工程，不可能一蹴而就、一劳永逸，需要各单位、各部门协同配合、同向发力，持续推进常态化整改；另一方面，从实践看，巡视整改制度机制不完善，是影响整改成效的一个重要因素。因此，必须着眼巡视整改各阶段、各环节、各方面，逐步构建一套覆盖巡视全周期、全要素、全流程的整改制度体系，压实整改责任，强化整改监督，为加强巡视整改和成果运用提供制度保障。\n\n\n\n　　2023年，中央巡视工作领导小组组织开展了“巡视整改和成果运用”课题调研，全面梳理巡视整改存在的突出问题，围绕健全工作机制研究提出一系列改进措施。中央巡视办会同中央纪委国家监委机关、中央组织部建立整改会商机制，强化工作统筹和协作配合，增强整改监督合力。\n\n\n\n　　各地积极探索加强巡视整改制度机制建设的有效方式，有的省修订印发新一届省委巡视工作五年规划，要求每轮巡视反馈后2年左右全覆盖式开展巡视整改落实情况“回头看”；有的省选取不同领域巡视对象开展巡视整改工作成效评估试点，并以此为基础总结经验、修订完善评估指标体系，为正式评估奠定基础……一系列跟踪督办、考核评估、问责等机制，进一步压实了整改责任，增强以巡促改、以巡促建、以巡促治实效。做好今年巡视工作，要深入贯彻落实中央纪委三次全会部署，建立覆盖巡视整改全周期的责任体系和制度流程，研究探索整改评估机制、问责机制，建设应用巡视整改监督管理平台，持续在强化巡视整改上见真章、求实效。\n\n\n\n　　持续完善巡视巡察工作格局，全面推动市县巡察向基层延伸\n\n\n\n　　党的二十大对健全党统一领导、全面覆盖、权威高效的监督体系提出明确要求。习近平总书记多次作出重要指示，强调要完善巡视巡察上下联动格局。经过新时代十年发展，我们党建立了中央、省、市、县四级巡视巡察体系，182家中央单位开展了内部巡视，构建了上下联动的工作格局，成为推进全面从严治党、加强党内监督的重要力量。\n\n\n\n　　贯彻落实中央纪委三次全会精神，要持续完善巡视巡察工作格局，加强对省区市巡视工作的指导督导，建立对中央单位内部巡视分板块、分行业指导的工作机制，全面推动市县巡察向基层延伸，以巡视带巡察，发挥上下联动的系统优势，扎牢织密监督网。\n\n\n\n　　省区市巡视是上下联动的关键环节，发挥着承上启下的作用。2023年，中央巡视机构持续加强对省区市巡视巡察工作指导，实现对全国省市两级巡视巡察办主任以及新任职县级巡察办主任培训全覆盖。要继续推进省区市巡视工作深化发展，督促党委落实巡视工作主体责任，指导巡视工作领导小组认真履职，充分发挥巡视办职能作用；加强对工作薄弱地区的调研指导，促进省区市巡视工作质量整体提升。\n\n\n\n　　中央单位内部巡视是上下联动、条块结合的重要环节。2023年，中央巡视机构针对中央单位数量多、领域广、差异大的特点，注重加强分类指导，召开中央单位巡视办主任专题研讨班、新任职巡视办主任集体谈话会，对61家中央单位开展内部巡视专项检查。下一步，要建立对中央单位内部巡视分板块、分行业指导的工作机制，搭建情况通报、经验交流平台，促进互学互鉴，持续推进中央单位内部巡视工作规范发展。\n\n\n\n　　加强对村（社区）巡察是坚持以人民为中心的体现，也是巡视工作深化发展的着力点。实践中，各地市县巡察机构积极探索对村（社区）巡察的有效方式。有的“市区联动”，集中巡察经济体量大、信访矛盾和廉洁风险较为突出的重点村（社区）；有的采取市县联动提级巡一批、重点乡村直接巡一批、乡村一体巡一批的方式，推进对村（社区）巡察全覆盖……各地对村（社区）巡察紧扣党中央关于巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果、全面推进乡村振兴、保障改善民生等决策部署加强监督检查，推动解决了一批群众反映强烈的急难愁盼问题，有效促进了基层监督和基层治理。新的一年，要深入总结运用实践经验，以加强对村（社区）巡察为抓手，全面推动市县巡察向基层延伸，进一步推动解决基层问题和群众身边问题，不断增强人民群众获得感、幸福感、安全感。\n\n\n\n　　新时代新征程，巡视工作肩负着重要的职责使命。1月31日，中共中央政治局会议在审议《中国共产党巡视工作条例》时强调，要坚持政治巡视定位，把“两个维护”作为根本任务，紧盯权力和责任，紧盯“一把手”和领导班子，紧盯群众反映强烈的问题，推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化。要深入学习贯彻习近平总书记关于党的自我革命的重要思想，落实中央纪委三次全会部署要求，抓好巡视工作条例的学习宣传贯彻，坚守政治巡视定位，充分发挥巡视综合监督作用，守正创新，勇于亮剑，以有力政治监督为中国式现代化提供坚强保障。\n（三）本地区近期出台的相关制度文件：\n近日，省委、省政府印发了《关于推进2024年全面从严治党、党风廉政建设和反腐败工作的意见》。\n\n\n\n《意见》强调，要以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深入学习贯彻习近平总书记关于党的自我革命的重要思想，全面落实二十届中央纪委三次全会精神和省委部署要求，以党的政治建设统领党的建设各项工作，纵深推进党风廉政建设和反腐败斗争，下大气力铲除腐败问题产生的土壤和条件，推动新征程全省纪检监察工作高质量发展，为全面建设社会主义现代化四川提供坚强保障。\n\n\n\n《意见》要求，要突出凝心铸魂深化拓展主题教育成果，持续在真学真懂真信真用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想上下功夫；突出“两个维护”强化政治监督，确保政令畅通、令行禁止；突出铲除土壤条件深化反腐败斗争，在一体推进不敢腐、不能腐、不想腐上精准发力、持续发力；突出常态长效纠治“四风”顽疾，更深层次纠治形式主义、官僚主义；突出严管严治加强党的纪律建设，推动党员干部自觉把铁的纪律转化为日常习惯和行动准绳；突出强基固本推动全面从严治党向基层延伸，坚决惩治群众身边不正之风和腐败问题；突出提升效能完善监督体系，更好释放监督治理效能；突出严管厚爱激励担当作为，更好推动干事创业。\n\n\n\n《意见》还以清单形式明确了重要任务分工。\n（四）近期查处的违纪违法典型案例数据：\n前三季度，全国纪检监察机关立案64.2万件，其中立案省部级干部58人；今年以来查处群众身边不正之风和腐败问题近60万个；前11个月，全国查处形式主义、官僚主义问题近9.2万起……\n\n\n\n反腐败高压态势不减，全面从严治党不断向基层延伸，整治形式主义、官僚主义持续加力……2024年正风反腐工作不松劲、不停步，自我革命始终利剑高悬。\n\n\n\n“主动投案”成高频词\n\n\n\n中央纪委国家监委通报的数据显示，今年前三季度，全国纪检监察机关共立案64.2万件，其中立案省部级干部58人。和去年同期相比，两项数据均有增长。\n\n\n\n“数据的增长，直观反映出反腐败斗争力度的不断加大和反腐败效能的持续提升，向社会传递了反腐败高压态势不会改变的清晰信号。”北京廉政法治协同创新基地主任、首席专家彭新林认为，当前反腐败工作清存量、遏增量的任务依然艰巨繁重，要正确认识反腐败斗争依然严峻复杂的现实形势，在铲除腐败问题产生的土壤和条件上持续发力、纵深推进。\n\n\n\n与此同时，“主动投案”成为高频词。不久前，北京粮食集团原副总经理姜鹏举在境外主动投案并被遣返回国。此前，还有青海省委常委、政法委书记杨发森，十三届全国人大华侨委员会副主任委员罗保铭等中管干部主动投案。\n\n\n\n“主动投案是反腐败工作成效的直观体现。”南开大学周恩来政府管理学院教授徐行认为，在未来的反腐败工作中，不仅要保持高压态势，还需要进一步强化基层执行力，推进权力透明化，加强对重点领域、关键环节党员干部特别是“一把手”的监督制约，真正实现监督无死角、全覆盖。\n\n\n\n惩治“蝇贪蚁腐”毫不手软\n\n\n\n今年4月以来，中央纪委国家监委在全国部署开展群众身边不正之风和腐败问题集中整治，集中时间、集中精力、集中力量，严查“蝇贪蚁腐”，纠治群众反映强烈的突出问题，推动反腐败斗争向基层延伸、向群众身边延伸。\n最新数据显示，2024年以来，全国纪检监察机关共查处群众身边不正之风和腐败问题59.6万个、处分46.2万人，移送检察机关1.5万人。\n\n\n\n“‘蝇贪蚁腐’主要聚集在与老百姓生活息息相关的教育医疗、养老社保、执法司法等重点领域，啃食的是人民群众最直接、最关心的利益。”北京廉政建设研究基地副主任宋伟认为，基层腐败治理的实际成效，直接影响着老百姓的获得感、幸福感、安全感，也深刻影响着反腐败斗争全局，必须加大惩治力度。\n\n\n\n徐行认为，在强化纪检监察机关监督整治的同时，也需要进一步构建多元监督格局。一方面，要加强基层党组织内部监督，健全村务公开和责任公示机制，提升治理透明度；另一方面要通过强化群众监督、民主评议、媒体曝光等手段，确保社会监督的深度介入，形成监督合力。\n\n\n\n对行贿行为惩治力度不断加大\n\n\n\n《中央反腐败协调小组工作规划（2023-2027年）》要求完善对行贿人的联合惩戒机制，建立行贿人“黑名单”制度；刑法修正案（十二）正式施行，进一步修改完善行贿犯罪规定，加大对行贿行为惩治力度；二十届中央纪委三次全会提出，强化受贿行贿一起查，完善对重点行贿人的联合惩戒机制……\n\n\n\n党的二十大以来，一系列制度性举措接连出台，向全社会持续释放坚持受贿行贿一起查的强烈信号。\n\n\n\n数据显示，今年前三季度，全国纪检监察机关立案行贿人员1.9万人，移送检察机关2972人。\n\n\n\n“行贿不查，受贿不止。”宋伟认为，行贿人的围猎腐蚀已成为当前腐败增量仍有发生的重要原因之一，行贿行为不仅破坏市场公平竞争、污染行业风气，也严重腐蚀着干部队伍，必须深刻认识行贿问题的政治危害，坚持受贿行贿一起查，才能提高腐败综合治理效能。\n\n\n\n彭新林认为，在健全对行贿人的联合惩戒机制、完善行贿行为法律规制体系的同时，也要坚决查处新型行贿和隐形行贿。“白手套”型行贿、披上“合法外衣”型行贿、受托理财型行贿、给予虚拟货币型行贿等手段“花样频出”，应综合分析其表现形式和演变趋势，增强发现和打击能力，让其无所遁形。\n\n\n\n持续为基层松绑减负\n\n\n\n根据中央纪委国家监委通报，今年前11个月，全国共查处形式主义、官僚主义问题近9.2万起，批评教育和处理近13.5万人，其中给予党纪政务处分约8.6万人。\n\n\n\n与此同时，整治形式主义为基层减负工作继续深入推进。今年以来，中央层面整治形式主义为基层减负专项工作机制办公室、中央纪委办公厅分3批公开通报了9起典型案例，持续强化警示震慑。\n（五）上级纪委关于党风廉政建设的新部署新要求：\n2024年全面从严治党、党风廉政建设和反腐败工作的总体要求是：坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深入学习贯彻党的二十大精神和习近平总书记来川视察重要指示精神，更加深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，按照二十届中央纪委三次全会、省纪委十二届三次全会、市纪委九届四次全会和区委历次全会工作部署，坚决贯彻全面从严治党战略部署，认真落实健全全面从严治党体系任务要求，深入开展党风廉政建设和反腐败斗争，保持战略定力，坚定信心决心，持续加强机关规范化、法治化、正规化建设，持续深化不敢腐、不能腐、不想腐一体推进，为新时代新征程农业强区建设提供坚强纪律保障，以农业农村的高质量发展夯实罗江现代化建设根基。\n\n\n\n一、加强政治机关建设，始终确保在思想、政治、行动上与党中央保持高度一致\n\n\n\n（一）坚持政治立场，确保正确方向。坚实建立政治

Write in the voice of a third-grade elementary school student. Kong Rong (153-208 CE) was a literary figure of the Eastern Han Dynasty, with the courtesy name Wenju. He was from the State of Lu (present-day Qufu, Shandong) and was the twentieth-generation descendant of Confucius, coming from a family of profound scholarly tradition. He was the leading figure of the famous \"Seven Masters of Jian'an\" and was known for his literary talent. Kong Rong was one of the more upright aristocratic representatives of his time, known for his integrity and pride throughout his life. He was ultimately executed by Cao Cao on false charges.\n\nAs a child, Kong Rong had five older brothers and one younger brother.\n\nOne day, the family was eating pears. A plate of pears was placed in front of everyone, and the brothers were told to take their picks. Guess what kind of pear Kong Rong chose? He didn't pick the best or biggest one; instead, he took the smallest pear. His father saw this and was very pleased: even though the child was only four years old, he was already so sensible. He deliberately asked Kong Rong, \"With so many pears to choose from, and being allowed to pick first, why did you take the smallest one?\"\n\nKong Rong replied, \"I'm young, so I should take the smallest one; the bigger ones should be left for my older brothers.\"\n\nHis father then asked, \"But you have a younger brother, isn't he even smaller than you?\"\n\nKong Rong said, \"I'm older than my younger brother, I'm his big brother, so I should leave the bigger ones for him.\"\n\nSee how well Kong Rong answered! His father heard this and laughed heartily, \"Good child, good child, truly a good child!\"\n\nAt just four years old, Kong Rong knew to give up pears, showing respect to both his older and younger brothers. Everyone praised him for this.\n\n[Story of Li Bai]\nAs a child, Li Bai, the famous Tang Dynasty poet, didn't like studying and often skipped school to wander the streets.\n\nOne day, instead of going to school, Li Bai was strolling around and unconsciously wandered outside the city. The warm sunlight, cheerful birds, and swaying flowers and grass made Li Bai sigh, \"On such a beautiful day, how boring it would be to stay indoors reading books!\"\n\nAs he walked, he came across an old woman with white hair sitting in front of a shabby thatched house, grinding a thick iron pestle. Li Bai approached her, \"Grandmother, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm grinding this iron pestle into an embroidery needle,\" the old woman looked up, smiled at Li Bai, then lowered her head and continued grinding.\n\n\"An embroidery needle?\" Li Bai asked, \"The kind used for sewing clothes?\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\n\"But the pestle is so thick, when will it ever become a thin embroidery needle?\"\n\nThe old woman asked Li Bai in return, \"If dripping water can pierce stone, and the Foolish Old Man could move mountains, why can't an iron pestle be ground into an embroidery needle?\"\n\n\"But you're so old...\"\n\n\"As long as I put in more effort than others, nothing is impossible.\"\n\nThe old woman's words made Li Bai feel ashamed. After that, he never skipped school again. He studied very hard every day and eventually became an immortal poet renowned through the ages.\n\n[Story of Han Feizi]\nDuring the Spring and Autumn Period, Han was a small state - among the Seven Warring States, Han was the weakest. Being close to Qin and under constant threat, plus having a weak king who let power fall into the hands of his ministers, the situation was very critical. This was the background of Han Feizi's life.\n\nThe King of Han looked down on Han Feizi. Though Han Feizi repeatedly submitted proposals to save the country, he had a stuttering problem. Once, when he met with the King to present his ideas, the King impatiently said, \"You can barely speak without stuttering, what brilliant plans could you possibly have?!\"\n\nThe King was truly foolish. As the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover. Han Feizi was there to help, how could the King speak to him like that? Even though Han Feizi stuttered, that was no way to treat him!\n\nWhether it was because of the King's words making him feel his talents were being wasted, or for some other reason, Han Feizi then devoted himself to writing. He expressed his feelings through his works, producing texts like \"Solitary Indignation,\" \"Five Vermin,\" \"Inner and Outer Collections,\" \"Collection of Sayings,\" \"The Difficulties of Persuasion,\" and others, totaling over 100,000 words.\n\nWhen his works reached the State of Qin, the King of Qin greatly admired them, saying, \"If I could meet this author and discuss matters with him, my life would be complete.\" The King of Qin's attitude toward Han Feizi made Li Si, the Prime Minister of Qin and Han Feizi's former classmate, very jealous, so he secretly spoke ill of Han Feizi.\n\nLater, Han Feizi was framed by Li Si and imprisoned. Fearing delays might spoil his plan, Li Si brought poison and forced Han Feizi to commit suicide. Han Feizi never imagined his life would end this way. In 223 BCE, Han Feizi died by poison.", "criteria": [{"name": "Age-Appropriate Voice", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response maintains the perspective and language of a third-grade student while explaining complex historical narratives.", "1-2": "Uses advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures completely inappropriate for third-grade level, with no attempt to simplify concepts.", "3-4": "Occasionally slips into adult-level explanations, with inconsistent voice and some vocabulary beyond grade level.", "5-6": "Maintains grade-appropriate language most of the time, but sometimes struggles with complex concepts.", "7-8": "Successfully uses child-like voice and grade-appropriate vocabulary, with only minor lapses in consistency.", "9-10": "Perfectly captures a third-grader's voice throughout, with appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and thought patterns."}, {"name": "Story Comprehension", "criteria_description": "Assesses understanding and accurate retelling of the key elements and moral lessons from each historical story.", "1-2": "Misinterprets major plot points and fails to identify the main messages of the stories.", "3-4": "Captures basic plot but misses important details and deeper meanings in multiple stories.", "5-6": "Accurately retells main events but occasionally misses subtle details or underlying themes.", "7-8": "Demonstrates clear understanding of stories with minor omissions in detail or interpretation.", "9-10": "Perfectly captures all key elements, morals, and nuances of each story while maintaining accuracy."}, {"name": "Personal Reflection", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the quality and depth of personal thoughts and reactions to each story from a child's perspective.", "1-2": "Provides no meaningful personal reflection or completely adult-oriented analysis.", "3-4": "Offers superficial reactions without connecting to personal experience or child-like understanding.", "5-6": "Includes basic personal thoughts but lacks depth or emotional connection to the stories.", "7-8": "Provides thoughtful reflections with good emotional connection, minor missed opportunities.", "9-10": "Offers genuine, age-appropriate insights that demonstrate both understanding and personal connection."}, {"name": "Length and Balance", "criteria_description": "Measures adherence to the 300-400 word requirement per story and balanced treatment of all three narratives.", "1-2": "Significantly under/over word count, with highly uneven treatment of stories.", "3-4": "Mostly outside word count range, noticeable imbalance in story coverage.", "5-6": "Generally within word count but with some variation, slightly uneven treatment.", "7-8": "Close to target word count with minor variations, mostly balanced coverage.", "9-10": "Perfect adherence to word count requirements with equal, thorough coverage of all stories."}, {"name": "Engagement and Flow", "criteria_description": "Assesses how well the response maintains reader interest and creates smooth transitions between ideas.", "1-2": "Disjointed writing with no clear flow, failing to maintain reader interest.", "3-4": "Choppy transitions and inconsistent engagement, with multiple awkward passages.", "5-6": "Generally readable but with occasional flow issues or engagement drops.", "7-8": "Smooth flow with minor transition issues, consistently engaging writing.", "9-10": "Perfectly engaging throughout with seamless transitions and maintained interest."}]}

Please help me create a video narration script about Ukiyo-e art for art museum guides. The content should focus on Katsushika Hokusai's representative works, using professional yet accessible language suitable for visitors with basic art knowledge. Specifically, it should include: 1) A relaxed and elegant introduction to the basic concepts of Ukiyo-e art; 2) Detailed analysis of Hokusai's \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\" series, especially the composition, color, and symbolic meaning of \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\"; 3) Analysis of Ukiyo-e art development in relation to the social and cultural background of the Edo period; 4) Interactive segments that encourage audiences to reflect on Ukiyo-e's influence on later art. The language style should be formal yet friendly, incorporating interesting details, with a duration of approximately 15 minutes.\n\nReference materials: Historical Social Life in the Edo Period: Ukiyo-e art reached its peak during the Edo period, which was inseparable from the social and cultural background of the time. The Edo period was a relatively stable and peaceful time in Japanese history. The shogunate implemented a strict social class system, creating a stable environment for artists to create. Meanwhile, urban development, especially centered around Edo, promoted the prosperity of commerce, handicrafts, and artistic culture.\n\nDuring this period, the rise of the urban class showed a strong interest in arts and culture. Ukiyo-e, with its vivid depiction style, colorful presentation, and popular content themes, attracted many viewers and became one of the mainstream art forms of the time. Ukiyo-e works covered various subjects, including actors, beautiful women, natural landscapes, historical events, and daily life scenes, attracting audiences from different social classes and making ukiyo-e art part of popular culture.\n\nThe production process of ukiyo-e was complex and precise. An artist would first create an original painting, usually a watercolor or ink painting, as a template for the final ukiyo-e. Then, woodblock carvers would copy it onto wooden blocks and precisely carve the lines and details. Ukiyo-e was typically a multicolor woodblock print, requiring a separate block for each color, completing the final work through overlapping prints of different colors. This multicolor woodblock printing technique was a complex and delicate craft at the time.\n\nThe Edo period had a strict social structure divided into four classes: samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants. The samurai class was at the top of society and enjoyed privileges, but with the arrival of peacetime, their military role gradually weakened, shifting towards administrative and cultural fields. Farmers were the main productive force in society, while artisans and merchants, though at the bottom of the social hierarchy, gradually gained wealth and influence as the economy prospered.\n\nDevelopment of Ukiyo-e Art:\nUkiyo-e (浮世絵) was a popular form of woodblock printing in Japan's Edo period, depicting daily life, folk customs, landscapes, and popular figures like kabuki actors and courtesans with fluid lines and vibrant colors. It vividly represented the lives and fashion trends of various social classes, serving as an encyclopedia of Japanese folk culture.\n\nThe development of ukiyo-e can be divided into four stages: early emergence in the 17th century, maturation in the 18th century, peak in the 19th century, and gradual decline in the 20th century. Its artistic characteristics are mainly reflected in:\n\nRich Themes: Ukiyo-e works covered scenes of daily life, historical stories, legends and myths, portraits of famous people, and beautiful women.\n\nVivid Colors: Ukiyo-e works used woodblock color printing techniques with bright colors, making the works particularly colorful and rich.\n\nStrong Decorative Elements: Ukiyo-e works often featured strong decorative qualities, with artists using various patterns and decorative elements.\n\nRealistic Portrayal: Ukiyo-e art focused on depicting human figures, especially beautiful women, with careful attention to posture, expression, and clothing.\n\nMultilayered Perspective: Ukiyo-e works often employed multilayered perspective effects to create depth and dimensionality.\n\nDuring the Edo period, ukiyo-e art became widely spread and loved, mainly due to its vivid depiction style, colorful presentation, and popular themes.

00:02\n我是小亚。我们在节目里面其实提到过很多次麦当劳，那麦当劳到底算一个什么公司呢？有的人认为它是一个销售特许经营权的公司，有的人认为他是个预制菜公司，有的人认为他是个地产公司。因为他在美国的业务收入有一部分是来自于特许经营商向他支付的房租。\n\n发言人1 00:21\n接下来感觉要跟一句，也有人认为不尽如此。\n\n发言人2 00:25\n感觉我们在说什么高考命题作文。但是在这么多说法里面，很少有人会想到，其实麦当劳是个餐厅。\n\n发言人1 00:34\n这是一个新发现的。所以是什么提醒了岳老师这个被忽略的真实性？\n\n发言人2 00:39\n因为我那天没有事情干，上麦当劳的官网在那里转，然后发现他们竟然有厨师，然后这个事情把我吓了一跳。\n\n发言人1 00:46\n所以不是什么厨师机器，是真的人的厨师。\n\n发言人2 00:50\n对，真人。所以麦当劳其实是有厨师，甚至说有主厨的。目前官网上披露的麦当劳厨师有两位，然后能够查到的历史上面还有好几年主厨。最早也最有名的一位是在1976年就加入到麦当劳了。\n\n发言人1 01:05\n这有点意思。所以麦当劳的主厨是干什么的这。\n\n发言人2 01:08\n就是我们这期节目想聊的话题。麦当劳的主要职责跟一般餐厅里面的主厨肯定有有很大差别。总体来说，他们更像是麦当劳整个产品研发流程上的一环。\n\n发言人2 01:20\n我们可以先介绍一下麦当劳目前的常规的新品的研发流程，总共分五步。首先一般是提前两年开始考量整个产品开发的策略，然后制定整个开发路线图。其次就是提前一年半开始做产品的研究开发和内部的试吃。第三就是提前一年来邀请一部分消费者来测试新品，然后做最后的微调。第四就是提前六个月做上市之前的各种准备，包括小范围的在门店的销售试水。最后一步才是新品的上市。\n\n发言人1 01:50\n从这个流程来看的话，麦当劳的主厨的作用应该主要体现在前两个环节。就是产品策略，还有具体研究和开发试吃那个部分。\n\n发言人2 01:58\n对的，一方面主厨的脑洞比较不受限制，他们可以在实验厨房里面尝试很多不可能在普通麦当劳门店里面出现的食材。另外一方面，他们其实又要考虑到这个产品落地的可行性，定价方案、盈利能力、投资回报率等等。所以其实从脑洞能够走到正式研发的这种产品也非常少。\n\n发言人2 02:18\n时代杂志早年去采访过麦当劳主厨，他披露一个数字，就是说麦当劳厨师每年想出来的点子大概有1800个。最后只有五个左右的新品能够进入到麦当劳全美的菜单里面。那常驻在菜单比例上就更少了。\n\n发言人1 02:34\n1800个一天要抢到5个也不容易。不过麦当劳毕竟是以自己所谓的这个菜单精简文明的，而且有很多虽然是现实的新品，但是巨无霸、麦乐鸡这些拳头产品其实很多都没变，就那么几个。\n\n发言人2 02:48\n麦当劳早年的很多强的单品，其实不完全是靠他们家自己研发出来的，而是推广了一些特许经营商的发明。典型的案例就是巨无霸和麦香鱼。麦乐基其实反而是一个卖到真正的自主研发。它整个的过程就是由当时公司的CEO让克劳克，然后他的主厨艾润和他的供应商泰森合力完成的那克劳克实验室提出了一个brief，就是我们要做小食，尤其是鸡肉类的小食。艾文就是研发出了麦乐基的具体做法，以及和他配合的三种战将，然后还设计了一个完整的生产流程，包括你要用什么机器来切鸡肉，怎么去安排人工去骨的这个流水线，然后鸡肉外面那个面糊要怎么调等等。安瑞的自己说卖了鸡外面那个面糊，就源自于天赋罗面糊的这个灵感。这样的吗？对，但是他需要根据麦当劳顾客可能喜欢的口感做很多细致的调味。\n\n发言人2 03:42\n另外一个点就是我们前面提到这个麦乐鸡蘸酱的研发。我们现在常吃的就是甜酸酱这一种，偶尔会有一些现实的特别蘸酱。但实际上在麦乐基最早推出的时候，还有两种蘸酱，一个是黄芥末酱，一个是烧烤酱。这个就是艾润从全球的几百种酱料微信当中挑出来的那最后泰森作为麦当劳供应商，他要保证麦乐鸡当时在整个北美市场上市时的供应要稳定。为此他们专门培育了一种鸡的品种，我觉得这个鸡主要是长兄肌肉，主要是集中他的胸部。然后这个鸡还有个名字就叫麦当劳先生。但是因为上市的时候这个麦乐鸡太火了，所以早年其实有一段时间是供应不上的，这个情况会出现。\n\n发言人1 04:25\n这个主要练胸的麦当劳先生，这名字实在是有点羞耻不过刚刚从叶老师讲述能看得出来，其实麦当劳的主厨更像是一个公司里面的一个研发负责人那种感觉。有一点。另外蘸酱这个点其实也蛮有意思的，因为在西餐的正餐里面，其实酱汁的调配也很重要。麦当劳的确也很重视这个环节，你像除了刚才讲的这个甜酸酱以外，他们的这个巨无霸的蘸酱，还有那个四川辣酱，其实名声也非常的响，都是可以单卖，甚至是可以炒高价的那种单品了。\n\n发言人2 04:56\n其实后来chef and eric还推出过一个很强的猪肉的单品，叫mic rape。它其实就是麦当劳比较大规模使用重组肉的一个案例。\n\n发言人1 05:06\n这个事知道之前的不太知道。\n\n发言人2 05:07\n对，因为这个单品在中国应该没有推过，所以我们就不细聊了。艾润在麦当劳这个主厨的职位一直是做到2004年，然后之后就有一位新的chef叫dan来接手了。Chef蛋和艾子宫职业路径比较相似，他们都是从厨师学校高分毕业，然后再到高级餐厅和连锁品牌历练一翻，最后再加入麦当劳的。\n\n发言人2 05:28\n当然现在也有一些什么乙方团队的厨师加入麦当劳的案例，比如说目前负责麦当劳全球菜单创新的一个shelf Roger，他之前就是泰森对接麦当劳业务的一个厨师，那我们说回chef单。这个人在任上开发出来的经典单品，其实没有麦乐基这么强。他比较有名，我们可能都知道的有两条线，一条叫麦咖啡。\n\n发言人1 05:51\n这也算是主厨开发。\n\n发言人2 05:53\n这个其实比经典单品的意义要更大，因为它相当于开发了一个完整的潜在的子品牌，以及以品的品类，它有点像一个平台的感觉了。另外一个很著名的单品就是安格斯牛肉堡。\n\n发言人1 06:05\n这个我自己还是吃过蛮多次的。虽然它价格更高一点，但是感觉它起了这样一个名字。它的品质和牛肉饼的这个厚度，反正是在我心目中，他现在是真正的巨无霸。\n\n发言人2 06:17\n安格斯牛肉堡其实就是严格的按照我们前面说两年这个开发全流程拿出来的一个单品。它是2009年上线的，当时也是麦当劳时隔很长时间拿出的第一个汉堡的新品。小flannery设计了三种安格斯牛肉堡，一种配的是番茄和酸黄瓜，这个就跟剧舞吧有点类似，一种配的是培根和芝士片，还有一种配的是蘑菇片。相比于当时麦乐基的只推一种单品做法，我觉得他做三种的好处就在于分散的供应链压力，也可以大规模测试市场反馈到底要吃哪个。\n\n发言人1 06:47\n而且就感觉这种相对比较高价的这个牛宝的话，它配不同的口味也更加加的可行一点。不过我还是蛮惊讶的，原来2009年就有安格斯牛肉堡了。我自己的这个体感好像就是近几年在中国比较多的看到。\n\n发言人2 07:00\n这个也涉及到一个麦当劳不同市场之间产品引进和研发分配的过程。麦当劳好像没有特别泄露过这个部分，然后查一些资料，我觉得可能是这个样子的。首先美国肯定还是麦当劳的研发的核心，它最重要的核心单品开发工作还是会放在美国的。他们会同时制定产品在全世界推广时的品质标准，比如说汉堡面包胚的高度，薯条的直径、色泽等等。然后他们会定期跟全球其他部门的团队碰面，他们会校准产品质量的一致性。\n\n发言人2 07:32\n其次麦当劳还会去设立一些地区性的研发中心。一方面这个研发中心可以负责区域内某个单独市场的，比如说限量型的新品研发。另外一方面他们也会和总部的研发团队合作，然后对一些即将引进的单品做一些本土化的微调。在这个本土化的过程可长可短，也要看当地市场对于这些单品的接受度。在安格斯牛堡这个例子里面，其实他从北美市场推出到中国市场上市，中间隔了十年，就算是一个比较大的。\n\n发言人1 08:00\n所以确实中国就是近几年才上市的。\n\n发言人2 08:03\n如果说一个单品的主体不变，只是说针对本土市场做一些口味的延伸和调整，现在其实也要花半年时间的。查到说2009年麦当劳曾经开放过一次他们位于香港铜锣湾的食品研发和品质管理中心，其实就是他们的研发厨房。这个区域中心领他同时负责亚太、中东和非洲的产品研发工作。它内部名字叫forbidden kitchen，中文名字更中2，叫御膳房。\n\n发言人1 08:33\n我就行行，可以。\n\n发言人2 08:35\n你可以想象一个人膳房其实在一家普通的麦当劳门店的地下。\n\n发言人1 08:39\n麦当劳起这些建筑还有机构的名字都是蛮中二的。\n\n发言人2 08:43\n这个御膳房里每一半的空间是一个完整的麦当劳的厨房，就标准厨房。另外一部分就是负责研发和创意的一些试验性的厨房。每天在里面上班的工作团队当时是有九个人，里面就有一位主厨叫lesson。在接受采访的时候，chef leslie就分享过一个产品本地化例子，叫麻辣猪宝宝。\n\n发言人1 09:06\n没有。\n\n发言人2 09:06\n只是宝宝，麻辣猪宝宝。这个产品最初是为中国市场研发的。然后他们想的是最初这个麻辣的味型要相对重点是那种四川的麻辣味型。但是他们找顾客试吃以后，就发现有人接受不了这个辣度，所以就把辣度降了一下。之后他们又想把这个麻辣猪宝宝推广到东南亚的其他国家，那边人更不能吃辣，所以说辣度就要进一步减少。\n\n发言人2 09:30\nChef lester在采访时候也说到说他们会在产品的开发和推广过程中考虑成本的问题。像这个麻辣猪宝宝原本定的上市时间是更早一些的。但是当年因为遇到了猪肉价格的上涨，麦当劳测算了一下回报率，最终推迟了所有猪肉产品的上市。这其实跟当年新ferriero个mic rib的时候面对问题是完全一致的。所以在北美max rib的回归周期基本上跟猪肉的价格周期是可以你对上的。就是只有在猪肉便宜的时候才会推这个产品。\n\n发言人1 10:00\n原来这个猪周期是一个全球都会面临的问题。\n\n发言人2 10:03\n那既然以后影响到麦当劳，很有意思，所以我看莱斯利在接受采访的时候说，她每天只有一半的时间在厨房里面，剩下的时间主要是看邮件以及和供应商开会。\n\n发言人1 10:13\n所以主厨身上除了厨房的油烟味，也有普通白领的单位。\n\n发言人2 10:18\n有班位麦当劳作为全球可能是最成功的餐饮品牌，它确实需要一些厨师的能力和创意来创造下一款可能会爆的大单品。但是如果这个单品无法通过严格的流程检验，也缺少世界级的供应链支持，美食也就只能停留在创意阶段。很难说一个麦当劳厨师会不会为了自己的日常工作而感到开心。但是如果创意真的被推向全世界，那一定是很令人骄傲的事情。\n\n发言人1 10:44\n这就是我们本周送上的商业小样，下期见，下期见。", "criteria": [{"name": "Dialogue_Structure_Authenticity", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response maintains natural conversation flow and authentic

Here are some widely recognized suggestions:\n\nHealthy Diet: A balanced diet is crucial for brain health. You should ensure adequate intake of proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Additionally, increasing consumption of fish, nuts, berries, and leafy green vegetables can help improve memory.\n\nRegular Exercise: Moderate physical exercise can promote blood circulation, providing more oxygen and nutrients to the brain, helping to improve memory and cognitive function. Doing aerobic exercises several times a week, such as walking, jogging, or swimming, can be beneficial.\n\nAdequate Sleep: Sleep is an important period for memory consolidation in the brain. Ensure sufficient sleep each night. Newborns need 16-20 hours/day, children need 10-12 hours/day, teenagers need 9-11 hours/day, and adults typically need 7-9 hours/day of sleep.\n\nMemory Training: Memory exercises through memory games, puzzles, reciting poetry or numbers can stimulate neural connections and communication in the brain, improving memory.\n\nMaintain Curiosity and Desire to Learn: Continuous learning and exploring new things can stimulate neural connections and growth, improving memory and thinking abilities.\n\nSocial Activities: Social activities can stimulate brain thinking and memory abilities. Regularly engaging in social activities with family and friends helps keep the brain active.\n\nReduce Tension: Mental stress from overstimulation, tension, and fear can negatively impact the brain and reduce memory. Regular encouragement and praise help maintain a relaxed mindset.\n\nAvoid Excessive Use of Electronic Devices: Long-term use of electronic devices can lead to distraction and decreased memory. Control usage time appropriately and take regular breaks for eyes and body, especially during learning or memory tasks.\n\nIn summary, improving memory requires a multi-faceted approach, including diet, exercise, sleep, memory training, social activities, mental health, and reasonable use of electronic devices. These methods can help the brain work better and improve memory efficiency. and provide me with a 15-minute solo podcast outline on the topic of \"Training Brain Memory\", with appropriate content expansion to enhance engagement", "criteria": [{"name": "Content Organization and Flow", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the podcast outline logically structures the memory training information and creates a coherent narrative flow suitable for a 15-minute format.", "1-2": "Completely disorganized structure with no clear flow or progression between topics; unsuitable for podcast format.", "3-4": "Poor organization with awkward transitions; timing and flow issues evident throughout the outline.", "5-6": "Basic structure present but some sections feel disconnected; adequate flow but could be more cohesive.", "7-8": "Well-organized with mostly smooth transitions; good progression of ideas with minor flow issues.", "9-10": "Expertly structured with seamless transitions; perfect pacing and progression for a 15-minute podcast format."}, {"name": "Content Expansion and Engagement", "criteria_description": "Assesses how effectively the outline expands upon the original content while maintaining audience engagement through examples, anecdotes, or interactive elements.", "1-2": "No meaningful expansion of original content; completely lacks engaging elements.", "3-4": "Minimal content expansion; few engaging elements that add little value to the presentation.", "5-6": "Moderate expansion with some engaging elements, but missing opportunities for deeper audience connection.", "7-8": "Good content expansion with effective engaging elements; most opportunities for audience connection utilized.", "9-10": "Exceptional expansion with highly engaging elements; maximizes audience connection while maintaining educational value."}, {"name": "Scientific Accuracy and Detail", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the accuracy of scientific information and the appropriate level of detail for a general audience while maintaining factual integrity.", "1-2": "Contains significant factual errors or misrepresentations of the science behind memory training.", "3-4": "Several minor inaccuracies or oversimplifications that could mislead listeners.", "5-6": "Generally accurate information but lacks depth in key areas; some oversimplification.", "7-8": "Accurate information with good balance of detail and accessibility; minor technical imprecisions.", "9-10": "Perfectly accurate information with ideal balance of scientific detail and accessibility."}, {"name": "Practical Implementation", "criteria_description": "Assesses how effectively the outline provides actionable steps and practical guidance for listeners to implement memory training techniques.", "1-2": "No practical implementation guidance; purely theoretical discussion.", "3-4": "Vague or impractical suggestions with limited real-world applicability.", "5-6": "Basic practical guidance provided but lacking specific steps or examples.", "7-8": "Good practical advice with specific steps; some areas could be more detailed.", "9-10": "Excellent practical guidance with clear, specific, and immediately applicable steps."}, {"name": "Time Management and Scope", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the content fits within the 15-minute format while maintaining appropriate depth and coverage of key topics.", "1-2": "Content significantly too long or too short for 15 minutes; major pacing issues.", "3-4": "Poor time allocation with some sections rushed or overextended.", "5-6": "Adequate timing but some topics receive disproportionate attention.", "7-8": "Good time management with minor adjustments needed in some sections.", "9-10": "Perfect time management with ideal coverage of all topics within the 15-minute format."}]}

In the teacher's eyes, you are an intelligent student who makes brilliant contributions in every class. You study diligently, have beautiful handwriting, and usually complete assignments accurately. However, recently, you've become a bit relaxed in your studies and less careful with homework. I hope you can correct these shortcomings, maintain higher standards for yourself, and be a good role model for your classmates. You will become even more excellent with effort!\n\n2. Looking at your big head and bright eyes, the teacher sees you as a clever and lovely boy. Teachers and classmates all enjoy hearing your stories - they're so engaging that everyone applauds. You're also a well-mannered child. Your homework has indeed improved, though you sometimes still procrastinate. If you can complete your assignments on time, your classmates and teachers will like you even more.\n\n3. In the teacher's eyes, you are a clever but mischievous student. Your academic performance is average, and you lack motivation. If you applied your intelligence to studying, you would certainly excel. Sometimes you misuse your cleverness, which is troubling. The teacher feels you're not as good as before, spending too much time thinking about play. Your grades won't improve this way. Hope you can clear your mind, strive for progress, and work hard to catch up with and surpass others.\n\nCommon Error Statistics:\nSpelling errors are the biggest point-losers! Big data shows that \"misspellings\" cause the most point deductions in compositions! Spelling errors account for 34.97% of all errors, with word spelling, capitalization, and punctuation errors ranking top three. Word basics are fundamental, and spelling mistakes are elementary errors that easily give examiners a bad first impression! While multiple choice questions make up the majority of English tests, students rarely practice spelling verification beyond classroom \"dictation.\"\n\nSentence errors cannot be ignored! Data shows that \"sentence errors\" follow \"spelling errors,\" accounting for 32.18%. Sentence errors include subject-verb agreement, missing elements, redundancy, voice, and tense errors.\n\nVocabulary challenges need addressing! Vocabulary errors rank third in English composition point deductions, accounting for 22.88%. Among vocabulary errors, verbs, nouns, and part of speech misuse rank top three, followed by pronouns, articles, prepositions, adjectives, conjunctions, and adverbs.\n(1) Verb errors: Present participle and verb combination misuse occur frequently.\n(2) Noun errors: Most common are countability and singular/plural form errors.\n(3) Part of speech misuse\n\nCollocation errors are significant! Collocation errors rank fourth in composition point deductions, accounting for 9.96%, mainly in \"idiom\" usage. Data shows that high-scoring compositions (80-100 points) mainly have collocation and sentence errors, while low-scoring ones (60-80 points) primarily show spelling and vocabulary errors.\n\nCorrection Marking Symbols:\n1. Use red pen for corrections, write neatly and standardly, mark grades and date in English.\n2. For corrected errors, students should circle the original red X with a different color to indicate proper correction.\n3. Mark grades (A, B, C) in the \"assessment\" box at top right of each classroom workbook page. Grades can be subdivided into A+, A, A-, etc.\n4. For lower grades, encourage using positive phrases like \"Excellent,\" \"Cool,\" \"Very good\" instead of rigid \"ABC\" grades to maintain interest.\n5. Use encouraging phrases like \"Good! Great! Wonderful!\" in copybooks. Simple flower drawings can be added for encouragement.\n6. Score dictation books on a 100-point scale; teachers can set minimum scores requiring retakes.\n7. Reward excellent workbooks with stickers; add encouraging phrases like \"Try your best,\" \"Come on\" for less satisfactory work.\nI am a primary school English teacher.

\n初中数学的学习不同于小学：小学是课内知识过于简单，课外的奥数较难，而且整个社会没有统一的教材，基本上都是各自研发，比如学而思的十二级体系。 而初中最终目标是中考，有明确的方向性，同时有统一规划的课本，知识体系非常完整。因此整个初中的学习更适合在一个合理而科学的体系下学习，唯一不同就在于不同的孩子可以选择不同的进度和难度。\n初中班型设置介绍:初一年级：基础班，提高班，尖子班，竞赛班，联赛班初二年级：基础班，提高班，尖子班，竞赛班，联赛班初三年级：基础班，提高班，尖子班，目标班联赛班走联赛体系，一年半学完初中数学知识；竞赛班走竞赛体系，两年学完初中数学知识；基础班，提高班，尖子班走领先中考培优体系，两年半学完初中数学知识。到初三不再设竞赛班和联赛班，统一回归到目标班，冲击中考。下面就各个班型的定位和适合什么样的学生做一个对比说明：\n2011年学而思初中教学体系\n体系\n联赛体系\n竞赛体系\n领先中考培优体系\n班型定位\n数学超常发展，冲击竞赛一等奖\n中考满分，兼顾竞赛\n同步提高，冲击中考满分\n学制设计\n一年半学完初中内容\n两年学完初中内容\n两年半学完初中内容\n课程容量\n每节课的课程容量与难度比竞赛班大1.2-1.5倍\n每节课的容量与难度比尖子班大1.5-1.8倍\n每节课的容量是校内课程的3-5倍，难度比校内课程高1.5-2倍\n适合学生\n课内知识掌握非常扎实，发展方向为冲击初中数学联赛，希望在数学方面有独特发展，例如未来参加IMO或CMO比赛，高中数学联赛冲击一等奖。\n课内知识学习轻松，在保证中考路径的同时兼顾拔高与竞赛。未来目标为冲击中考满分，同时参加一些数学竞赛，激发兴趣，锻炼思维。\n从课内知识上夯实基础、同步提高，同时拓宽视野，系统化学习，目标冲击中考满分\n入学体系\n10次课学完初一----预备班选拔考试----联赛竞赛预备班----参加入学选拔考试----通过后选择联赛体系---开始学习\n10次课学完初一----预备班选拔考试----联赛竞赛预备班----参加入学选拔考试----通过后选择竞赛体系---开始学习\n10次课学完初一----入学测试题----领先中考培优体系---开始学习\n班次安排\n联赛1班、联赛2班\n竞赛班\n基础班、提高班、尖子班，初三加开目标班\n学而思的初中数学有一套非常成熟的教学体系，既能满足我们的终极目标----中考，同时还能兼顾一些希望走竞赛路线的孩子。现在应该考虑的问题是我们适合走哪条路线？【选择联赛】如果孩子在数学方面特别优秀，希望未来在数学方面有独特发展，或者希望通过竞赛升学，推荐可以选择联赛班。初中有非常权威的比赛-----全国初中数学联赛。同时学而思有大批经验丰富的联赛教师，有足够的实力帮助孩子取得联赛好成绩。【选择竞赛】如果孩子从小对数学非常有感觉，学习数学非常轻松，但又不愿意走纯竞赛路线，只是希望能通过竞赛检验和锻炼孩子，最终目标还是中考，建议可以选择竞赛班。竞赛班的目标是冲击中考满分，进度相对较快，同时兼顾备战竞赛。【选择培优】如果考虑到孩子全方面发展，希望在校内学习的基础上能有更大的提升和更系统化的学习，目标是中考满分，推荐可以选择领先中考培优体系，比如尖子班。事实上学而思2010年的6个中考状元中有3名孩子就是一直走的领先中考培优体系。【 培优体系介绍】如同我们小学的十二级一样，初中有《领先中考培优课程》六级体系。六级体系是学而思教育专家团队经过5年中考培优经验的积累和沉淀，在2010年推出的完整的中考数学知识体系。它结合北京现行的主流教学进度，又有部分延伸和拓展。【解读六级体系特点】一、六级体系是个封闭的整体，每个学期都有严密的课程规划，环环相扣紧密联系。二、寒、暑假期不在是预习课，而是隶属于六级体系中的一环，等价于春秋季课程。三、春、秋季不在回顾之前的知识，完全按照六级体系继续延伸，学习新的知识点。【整体规划】\n《领先中考培优课程》六级体系\n年级\n暑假\n秋季\n寒假\n春季\n初一年级\n一级上\n一级下\n二级上\n二级下\n初二年级\n三级上\n三级下\n四级上\n四级下\n\n【横向对比】（以初一寒假和春季班做对比）\n初一数学寒假-->春季大纲对比\n寒假\n学习内容\n春季\n学习内容\n第一讲\n平行线的性质和判定（图形8级）难度：★★★\n第1讲\n平行线的构造与应用（图形9级）难度：★★★★\n第二讲\n三角形的认识（三角形1级）难度：★★☆\n第3、4讲\n三角形两大模型（三角形2级）三角形三大专题（三角形3级）难度★★★☆\n第三讲\n复杂二元一次方程组（方程5级）难度★★★☆\n第5、6讲\n含参方程组（方程6级）二元一次方程的应用（方程7级）难度★★★★\n第四讲\n含参不等式（不等式2级）难度★★★☆\n第7、8讲\n不等式应用（不等式3级）方程与不等式综合（不等式4级）难度★★★★★\n第五讲\n平面直角坐标系认识初步（函数1级）难度★★☆\n第2讲\n平面直角坐标系中的变换（函数2级）难度★★★☆\n第六讲\n统计与知识回顾（统计1级）难度★★★\n第10至13讲\n整式的乘法公式及相关全等三角形及相关难度★★★★★\n第七讲\n综合检测\n第14、15讲\n综合检测及名校真题点拨\n\n【纵向对比】（以初一寒假学的方程为例）\n方程\n标题\n级别\n时期\n一元一次方程初步\n方程1级\n初一暑假\n二元一次方程组的概念及基本解法\n方程2级\n初一暑假\n含参一元一次方程的解法\n方程3级\n初一秋季\n方程中的设元\n方程4级\n初一秋季\n复杂二元一次方程组\n方程5级\n初一寒假\n含参方程组\n方程6级\n初一春季\n二元一次方程的应用\n方程7级\n初一春季\n分式方程\n方程8级\n初二秋季\n一元二次方程认识初步\n方程9级\n初二寒假\n一元二次方程的常用解法及判别式\n方程10级\n初二寒假\n解特殊方程\n方程11级\n初二春季\n特殊根问题\n方程12级\n初二春季\n根系关系与应用题\n方程13级\n初二春季\n【小升初衔接班介绍】【10次课学完初一-----小升初衔接班】初中与小学最大的不同在于初中非常重视基础，重视解题的逻辑性与严密性，而这些学习习惯恰恰孩子小学学习时候最欠缺的。所以学而思初中数学开始的第一门非常重视基础的课程就是：10次课学完初一。“10次课学完初一”是学而思的一门金牌课程，最早学习这门课程的孩子们现在正在读高三。也就是这门课程帮助过无数的孩子提前学习了初一的内容，让孩子们开学后能顺利适应初中的学习，有一个良好的开始。\n“10次课学完初一”教学大纲\n第一讲\n有理数之六大必考概念\n第二讲\n有理数之四则运算\n第三讲\n科学计数法及有理数的混合运算\n第四讲\n整式的概念及加减法运算\n第五讲\n一元一次方程的解法及应用\n第六件\n二元一次方程组\n第七讲\n不等式（组）解法\n第八讲\n几何初步之线段、直线、射线与角的相关概念及运算\n第九讲\n几何初步之证明与推理\n第十讲\n几何初步之证明与推理\n【联赛竞赛预备班】在学完10次课的基础上，如果孩子愿意走联赛、竞赛路线，可以参加联赛竞赛预备班的学习。上课之前需要参加“联赛竞赛选拔考试”，时间为2011年6月18日。考试通过的孩子，会参加联赛竞赛预备班。课程结束后会参加联赛竞赛班选拔考试，考试通过后可以选择走联赛路线或竞赛路线。\n1、没有最好的班次，只有最适合孩子的班次\n　　超常班是很多孩子和家长所向往的，但并不意味着所有孩子都适合超常班的学习。最主要的，是根据孩子现有的能力，选择合适的班次。做个可能不太恰当的比喻，就像开车一样，在合适的速度选择合适的档位，才能最快的加速。如果一味的选择较高的档位，不单加速慢还会毁车。学习奥数也一样，只有在合适的班次，才能保证学习效果。反之，一方面不能保证学习效果，还会影响孩子的学习兴趣。\n　　2、公平的竞争机制更有利于孩子的成长\n　　超常班是牛孩的聚集地，能够考入超常班是很多孩子和家长的期望，但没有绝对的牛孩，某一次考试代表不了成功与失败，小升初才是我们最终的战场。我们要给超常班一个明确的定位：“他并不是光环，而是给更适合的孩子提供更合适的学习空间”。“他并不是温床，而是给孩子们提高一个有利成长的公平竞争机制”。在不断竞争中孩子有目标、有动力、有劲头，不骄傲、不放弃。在学习的过程中通过不断的竞争享受学习带来的快乐，为小升初做好充足的准备\n\n\n\n海报要求：1)字数控制在400-500字左右；2)需要突出我校资深教师团队(均为重点高校数学系毕业，有5年以上教学经验)和往期学员在奥数竞赛中的优异成绩；3)文风要亲和有活力，适合家长阅读，传递专业可信赖的形象；希望通过这份文案吸引家长关注并报名咨询。",

Gazing at the star-studded sky, I would curiously imagine my beautiful future. The moon would stare at me dreamily, and the stars would keep winking at me, gradually drawing me into deep thought... As I grew older, I preferred staying by the window on rainy days, watching the drizzling rain outside, closing my eyes to feel the pleasant sensation of cool breeze on my face, reminiscing about childhood fun, with a slight smile appearing on my lips.\n\nSince childhood, I've loved rainy days, and particularly loved going out without an umbrella in the rain. Whenever the weather granted my wish (when it rained), I would quietly sit in the classroom, not going anywhere, sometimes doing homework when bored. After a while, I would see that familiar figure with that bright red umbrella at the classroom door. This is why I loved rainy days and going without an umbrella. Father would habitually open the red umbrella, then hold me close, taking my small hand in his large one as we strolled in the rain. Along the way, I would constantly tell father about the interesting things that happened during the day, whether I was praised or criticized. Those were my happiest moments.\n\nAs the years steadily added their rings, everything in the world changed at time's command. And I, too, was slowly growing up. The heavy schoolwork and pressure almost suffocated me, yet my grades remained mediocre. Looking at myself in the mirror, I saw no color - no bright red showing vitality, no deep black hiding potential, just gray. It occupied my sky! However, while everything else changed, I found that the joy brought by rainy days remained constant.\n\nOn another rainy day, I hadn't expected father to come pick me up, though he no longer held that once-bright red umbrella. Again under father's umbrella, with his arm around my shoulder, I seemed to sense something. Walking in step with father, I looked up at his face and noticed his graying temples, which I had never paid attention to before. Something stirred within me. At that moment, I smiled.\n\nAn umbrella shields us from the wind and rain, while father has raised another sky for my entire life and everything in it. Under the umbrella, father's love for me runs wild like ten thousand galloping horses in my heart, leaving me with paths already paved.\n\nMy sky is blue because of father, vast because of father. essay.

"这次实习，也是毕业实习，是我们即将毕业步入工作岗位前的一次重要的实践活动，我们每一名大四的学生都认识到了这次实训的重要性。所以，每个人都为此做了充足的准备。我也是如此，从大三开始我就开始为此做准备了，希望毕业后能够立足社会，希望自己能胜任自己的岗位。也是这个原因，我在整个实习期间都很努力。无论是在公司办公室期间，还是在现场，我都用自己的勤奋、好学、以及认真的态度对待每一件事情，我不怕吃苦，不怕困难，勇于去尝试，善于总结积累，乐于从挑战中学习经验，所以，我对我的实习还是比较满意的。现在，我将要把我这段时间学习、实践所得到的东西部分的描述出来，希望老师能为我的努力给予肯定，更希望老师能悉心教导，指出我的不足，我将虚心接受批评，并在之后的工作学习中努力改正，不断提高自己作为一名采访专员的专业素养!\n\n　　一、毕业实习单位简介\n\n　　西安嘉华木文化艺术传媒有限公司成立于2020年06月29日，注册地位于陕西省西安市长安区韦曲街办南长安街428号申店新村小区2504室，法定代表人为韩吉。经营范围包括一般项目：采访各类媒体热点：艺（美）术品、收藏品鉴定评估服务；文艺创作；组织文化艺术交流活动；文化娱乐经纪人服务；其他文化艺术经纪代理；娱乐性展览；摄像及视频制作服务；咨询策划服务；个人互联网直播服务；企业总部管理；企业管理；公共事业管理服务；资产评估；市场调查（不含涉外调查）；企业形象策划；市场营销策划；礼仪服务；品牌管理；广告制作；打字复印等。\n\n　　二、实习内容及过程\n\n　　我来到西安嘉华木文化艺术传媒有限公司开始了实习，职务是采访专员。作为采访员既要采访、写作，又要编辑的实践确实很能锻炼人，从刚开始的颇感不适到现在的顺其自然，这短暂却难忘的时光，我有着太多的收获。\n\n　　这次实习给我提供了一个机会和平台，使我得以将课堂所学予以运用和发挥，锻炼了自己的新闻业务技能。通过实习，使我对新闻行业和新闻工作有了更具体、更直接、更深刻的认识。实习，不仅仅是实践，更重要的是通过实践获得某种认识，从而能指导以后的实践。此外，通过实习还锻炼了我的社会活动和交往能力。\n\n　　在实习期内，我深入到各地去采访，真正的锻炼自己的采访能力，提高了自己的提问水平，锻炼了心理素质。在采访后写了很多的`新闻稿件，熟练地掌握了各种新闻文体的写法，尤其是消息和通讯的写法，包括各种新闻文体，如动态消息、综合消息、评述性消息、人物通讯、事件通讯、工作通讯、风貌通讯等，涉及到了经济、社会等各个领域。\n\n　　可以说，实习是综合能力的一次全面考验，除了考察你的专业水平和理论知识以外，还考察了你的处世态度，做人原则以及处事方法，简而言之，就是考察你是否懂得怎样做人。勤奋是首要的，到得最早走得最晚，通宵达旦这些都应该是家常便饭而不是邀功领赏的资本，因为你是实习生，你是来学习的;主动与老师的交流同样重要，不要窝在办公室里异想天开，要及时和记者沟通，善于和记者交流，要放得下面子，同样，因为你是实习生，你是来学习的;追求新闻理想，遵守新闻道德同样我们也不应忽视，应该坚决抵制诱惑，固守新闻客观真实的这一方净土同样是因为你是实习生，你是来学习的。此外，创造性地思考和大胆的实践也是专业实习过程中所应具备的素质。从生活中，主动发掘新闻线索，包括从媒体炒过的看似过时的话题中提炼新闻线索，大胆报题，勇于独立策划采写，不要怕出丑，不要怕弄巧成拙，还是因为你是实习生。\n\n　　后来渐渐多了自己采访的机会，每次的采访回来，都会有不同的问题出现，幸好同事们都很乐意帮助我，告诉我哪些地方做的不够好，需要改进，哪些地方可以做得更好。例如说，刚开始采访时，问的问题关联性不够强，不够针对，有时问问题又过于绝对，被访对象只回答是或者不是，又或者问完一个问题后没有跟进。这些问题，在课堂上老师都有强调过要避免的，听的时候好像很容易，但是到了自己真正操作的时候，经常都是遇到一些自己不熟悉的题目和采访对象，手忙脚乱，心里紧张得被访对象回答什么都记不清楚，也无法说按照他们的回答继续跟进问下去。\n\n　　后来自己总结的时候，也认为，在实习的过程中，保持平稳的心态也是很重要的，不能遇到什么自己不熟悉的采访对象时，就慌慌张张的。\n\n　　我们需要在平淡的事实中挖出吸引眼球的部分，不仅仅要靠平时的磨练，更需要对整个事件的“了如指掌”。况且是周报，无论什么新闻都不能依照日报的样式那么简单，而是应该深入调查研究，写出深度，写得深刻。\n\n　　三、实习收获\n\n　　几个月的实习使我深深体会到，要想取得较好的成绩，以下几点是我们必须做到的：\n\n　　1、真诚待人。\n\n　　作为一个采访员，而我自己本身是个相对比较内向的。不太擅长主动和别人交流打交道。在此次实习过程中我也发现了自己的不足。比如在刚开始实习的几天内。我比较怯生。面对沉默不语的尴尬。自己有责任和义务去与别人主动交流。在工作的时候同样也要积极主动地与老师交流。在今后的社会工作中。工作不再是一个人所能完成的。那是几个人或是一个团队的工作。而且你还必须去帮助别人或是接受别人的帮助已完成工作。因此你不能期望你自己一个人就能完成任务，或是看到别人有困难也不去帮。\n\n　　由于对业务的不了解以及专业知识的不熟悉。只能够在领导的安排下进行一些相对简单的工作。但是我也很积极地去帮助别人完成自己力所能及的工作。就比如在实习中,在领导没有分配任务的空暇里。我就常主动询问周围的工作人员有没有需要帮忙的。有时候别人也不好意思麻烦我。我就主动协助他们的工作。这样子不仅锻炼了自己。帮助了他人。还融洽了你与别人之间的关系。在以后的工作中人家也更乐意和你交往了。由此我深深体会到真诚的重要性，在工作中不仅要学会如何做事，更要学会如何做人，正确处理与同事之间的关系。这关系到工作的顺利开展和个人成长进步。孤芳自赏、自视清高的人很难融入大集体。\n\n　　2、踏实勤恳，勤学好问。\n\n　　到一个陌生的环境里。很多事情都不太了解。如果自己盲目去做。很可能会出问题。\n\n　　我们要抱着踏实的态度来做事。虚心点往往能得到别人的认同。我们在学校里面学习了一年的理论知识。但是实践经历却很少，真正接触新闻行业的机会不多。所以当我遇到不懂的问题的时候。我尽量多请教实习时间比较长的实习生。或者向部门老师讨教。这样。很多情况就可以很快掌握。也为自己的努力奠定了基础和提供了方向。工作时一定要一丝不苟。认真仔细。对待每一条新闻审稿一定要小心谨慎。不能出错。有时候一个失误不仅仅使你自己的工作进程受阻。还会影响广播播出的新闻质量。因此认认真真地做每一件事情就显得尤其重要。\n\n　　为了不使自己前功尽弃。我在刚开始工作的时候一定要慎之又慎,对自己的工作要十分重视。如果有必要一定要检验自己的工作结果。以确保自己的万无一失。在你对工作开始了解并熟练后。你会发现自己已能不用检验就能保证工作的质量了。而此时你也许不需要总是重复检验工作结果。但还是要对自己的工作认真对待。以免失误。\n\n　　3、在工作岗位上一定要勤于思考,不断改进工作方法,提高工作效率。\n\n　　公司的日常工作都会比较繁琐。而且几天下来也会比较枯燥。就是需要你多动脑筋。不断地想方设法改进自己的工作方法。寻找或是设计简捷的流程。提高工作效率。减少工作所需时间。实际上勤于思考在工作中是很重要的。吴老师在这方面帮了我很大的忙。他指导我在思考如何提高工作效率的同时。也自己也能够学到更多的知。掌握更多的新闻稿件写法技能。当你在较短的时间内就完成了自己的工作。你将留下更多的时间去放松。去学习。步入社会就需要了解基本礼仪。而这往往是原来作为学生不大重视的。无论是着装还是待人接物。都应该合乎礼仪。才不会影响工作的正常进行。\n\n　　四、工作存在的问题及改进措施\n\n　　1.要学会从公司人员的语言、表情、动作去看一个人的内心世界了解一个人的处世态度。只有真正接触了才了解公司其实不会像学校那么简单尽管学校也会有一些社会前兆那是还不是那么现实。起码学校不会牵涉到工资等势力因素所以最多也就是闹得内心不愉快罢了。而公司是更为复杂的很多都是皮笑肉不笑的人所以被同事笑话单纯试想如果不单纯地寄生我或许将会陷入小集团的明争暗斗之中，我何必呢？\n\n　　2.在整个的实习过程中，我深深的感觉到自己所学知识的肤浅和在实际运用中的专业知识的匮乏，刚开始的一段时间里，对一些采访工作感到无从下手，茫然不知所措，这让我感到非常的难过。在学校总以为自己学的不错，一旦接触到实际，才发现自己知道的是多么少，这时才真正领悟到“学无止境”的含义。从实习的开始到实习的深入，再到实习的结束，我进一步了解了自己，有了自己的一个理想定位，一个今后的计划打算。努力改变自己，努力提高自己，努力让自己适应，让自己发光。\n\n　　记者这个行业就像是参加一个马拉松比赛，很艰苦，奖品再丰厚也只能到了终点才能拿。起跑的快慢并不重要，在于的是你去跑的这个过程，但是在这个过程中，不会有人去帮你，是不是能胜利，都是靠你自己。\n\n　　人生也就是一场马拉松，怎么跑，都在于自己。要送给自己一个怎么样的人生，完全都是靠自己。\n\n\n\n

"基于智能家居套装新品发布资料智东西5月21日报道，今天下午，在2023美的全屋智能新品发布会上，美的发布了厨房空调、冰箱、洗烘套装、烟灶套装等全屋智能新品。同时，美的还提出了全屋智能“情境”概念，以满足用户更为个性化的需求。\n\n美的集团全屋智能负责人尚喆博士介绍道，在美的看来，用户需要的是智能家居、智能家电深度协同所带来的满足不同人个性需求的能力。因此，美的提出了“情境”概念，让智能家居设备联动满足用户在不同时间、不同空间的个性化需求，比用户的场景需求范围更小。\n\n此次，基于上述新品，美的发布会上介绍了儿童全流程恒温沐浴情境、35分钟代哄睡情境、烟灶空联动舒爽情境三大场景。同时美的还构建了美的智能情境库，用户可以上传自己的定制情境，也可以下载其它用户的情境来设置自己家中的家居设备。\n\n从全屋智能市场的发展来看，尚哲博士告诉智东西，当下制约全屋智能普及的原因包括：用户对全屋智能的需求还没有成系统；其次，用户在设想需求的同时，与市场上现有的解决方案存在差距。不过当下很多技术的突破性进展，会让更智能、联动性更好、更主动的全屋智能实现更快。\n\n谈及最新的大模型热潮，他透露道，目前美的内部已经有明确的研发项目，搭载大模型的硬件产品最快会在年内发布。\n\n一、从空间、场景到“情境”，让全屋智能体验更私人订制\n\n2018年中国家庭平均拥有0.9台智能设备，2025年这一数字预计将变为6.8台，美的集团全屋智能负责人尚喆博士谈道，未来的生活必然由智能主导。\n\n随着互联网、人工智能技术的快速发展，用户的智慧生活每天都在发生变化。他补充道，美的在全球服务了超4亿家庭、实现1500万月活和超过2亿台激活设备，场景执行次数超过11亿次。基于此，“让我们更加理解用户究竟需要什么”。\n\n因此，美的全屋智能发展呈现出以下的特征，首先是与人无关的空间划分，再到研究用户共性需求的场景划分，最后则为用户需要的智能家居、智能家电深度协同所带来满足不同人个性需求的能力。尚喆博士说：“我们称之为情境。”\n\n图片\n\n美的对于情境的定义是，情境相比于场景更小，有专属定制、深度控制、主动开启三个特点，针对不同人在不同时间、空间的需求做出调整。\n\n美的集团中国区域用户与市场总监陈亚飞称，事实上，用户在具体的产品品类中会有细分需求。因此，基于用户特征分析，去年12月底，美的就发布了全屋智能家电三大产品DNA及主张，形成了人因智能、人感科技、人居设计三大产品思路。\n\n其要做的就是从满足用户的基础需求到更深层次需求。他补充道，也就是在产品本体功能升级的同时，进一步探索基于用户更深层次需求的功能，如无烟感等。\n\n美的在人感科技方面积累了人工智能视觉感知技术、人工智能声音识别技术、气味传感器（电子鼻）技术、非接触温感技术、毫米波雷达睡眠监测技术、味觉传感器（电子舌）技术等。\n\n图片\n\n二、三大情境方案演示，智能家居自动交互、感知、决策\n\n美的演示了三大情境方案，分别为儿童洗澡、家长哄睡、厨房场景下的具体用户需求及智能家居设备的联动体验。\n\n1、儿童全流程恒温沐浴情境：提前热水、环境恒温\n\n作为家长，为孩子洗澡时，需要提前准备洗浴环境，洗澡过程中控制水温恒温，以及保证浴室、客厅、卧室的温度恒定，不会出现一冷一热。\n\n在儿童全流程恒温沐浴情境下，用户只需要通过语音启动这一情境，智能管家屏就可以通过日常感知、识别的行为数据，提前设置洗浴环境和水温，包括智能浴霸提前60秒预热，洗澡结束前10分钟，卧室、客厅空调开启制热。\n\n图片\n\n此外，这一情境下还可以感知、分析、预测每个家庭成员的洗澡习惯。\n\n2、35分钟代哄睡情境：睡前、熟睡阶段设备自动感知、决策\n\n儿童睡眠的问题十分受家长关注。原因在于，首先大脑的发育程度与睡眠的时长、质量、习惯高度相关，其次生长激素分泌的高峰期是儿童每天晚上进入深度睡眠的夜间10点到凌晨1点。然而，据了解，76%的中国家长认为宝宝存在睡眠问题。\n\n对于家长来说，想要科学哄睡孩子需要注意时机、环境以及家长的陪伴等等综合因素。\n\n基于此，美的35分钟代哄睡情境下，美的全屋智能设备会识别孩子是否疲惫，然后自动关闭窗帘、灯，然后想起哄睡故事。当孩子进入浅睡眠阶段后，相应智能家居设备同样会调节夜灯、空调风、讲故事声音。最后，在深度睡眠阶段，会关闭灯光、讲故事声音。\n\n图片\n\n同时还会根据当前孩子睡眠的体态、室内湿度和二氧化碳浓度来动态调整室内空气环境。\n\n3、烟灶空联动舒爽情境：空调、烟灶分时段自动调节\n\n一般而言，厨房是全屋温度最高的地方，和客厅会有10度左右的温差，灶台边温度会高达60度。这样的话，用户在厨房中需要调节烟机档位、空调，很容易影响火候控制或耽误时间。\n\n因此，在烟灶空联动舒爽情境中，多维空气感应立方可以实时监测温湿度、油烟、空气质量，同时联动开启油烟机、灶具、厨房空调。\n\n尤其在中午，一天中温度最高的时间，如果传感器识别到室温过高，就会开启厨房空调，同时油烟机也会自动调到静音状态。如果晚饭时间，用户需要做比较繁琐、油烟较重的爆炒菜系，厨房空调也会切换到大风量的爆炒模式，实现30秒快速降温。同时烟机自动调节至最高档位。\n\n图片\n\n同时，美的云食谱平台还能基于用户家庭里的食材来制定食谱，联动空调、油烟机、灶具满足不同的烹饪方式。\n\n这三大情境方案已上传至美的智能情境库。\n\n三、人因智能云、三类超级终端、四大家电系统\n\n支撑美的全屋系统的美的人因智能系统分为三大层级，中心层由人因智能云、三类超级终端、四大家电系统构成。\n\n人因智能云由大数据平台、大模型算法和加速器连接平台共同构成，可对家庭的内部环境和外部世界的各种信息进行训练与处理，并实现自动化决策。\n\n三类核心终端分别代表了连接与本地计算的家庭主机，代表感知的传感器以及代表消费的智慧中控系统，这也构建了美的家庭智能化的三大基础。\n\n同时尚哲博士透露，中心层的三类核心终端将在年内发布。全屋智能主机可以支持上百个设备连接，并做到断网可控，同时能执行本地AI算法。传感器组合产品则包括4D雷达传感器、多维空气传感器立方、智能管家屏。\n\n图片\n\n其中，4D雷达传感器能够对人体位置进行感知，多维空气传感器立方可以对环境做出精确的监测，智能管家屏则能够在家中和任意空间通过语音、屏幕与家庭成员进行实时的交互，去控制家庭中空调、灯光、窗帘等设备。\n\n图片\n\n四大核心的家电系统是美的全屋空气、全屋用水、烹饪饮食和家电能源。尚哲博士称，通过家电系统的整合与联动，以及和家居系统的深度融合，美的形成了全屋智能系统。\n\n外层执行层包括美的全品类智能家居以及灯光、面板、门锁等智能家居产品，这些智能家居产品会在第一时间执行中心层发出的指令。\n\n最后的体验层就是基于中心层、执行层为用户构建满足不同需求的情境。\n\n结语：全屋智能线下渠道或成销售主力\n\n当下，全屋智能市场的普及率来看仍然较低，但智能化是用户智慧生活的必然发展趋势。同时，智能家居设备的碎片化特征也一直是这一行业的通病，在帮助智能家居设备实现互联互通上，国外有CSA联盟发起的Matter标准，国内有开放智联联盟（OLA），都在为智能家居设备制定统一的连接标准。\n\n不过，尚喆博士也谈道，用户并没有对全屋智能需求建立起系统性认知也是阻碍其普及的一大原因，因此，美的启动了200家全屋智能体验店升级，使得用户能更直观地感受到智能家居设备的联动性等。再加上，如果上述连接标准能够真正解决智能家居设备的碎片化难题，或许能使得体验更好的全屋智能解决方案出现，使得全屋智能行业的市场规模进一步扩大。，创作一个30秒的微博直播预告视频脚本，主题为。具体要求：\n1.

"请帮我完善这篇运动品牌故事2008年8月，北京奥运会现场，一个长相颇似孔令辉，年龄大约四十岁上下的中年男人正沉默地坐在看台上。几天时间里，台下的林丹、李小鹏、郭晶晶、张怡宁等中国运动员一次次伴随着国歌奏起，登上了最高领奖台。\n\n这是家门口的奥运，在这次奥运会中，共计产生了43项新世界纪录与132项新奥运纪录，中国以51枚金牌数量，高居金牌榜榜首，成为奥运历史上首个登上金牌榜首的亚洲国家。\n\n这个沉默的中年人名叫丁世忠，是国产运动品牌安踏的创始人。此刻，他万分想不通的是，为什么中国人家门口的奥运，领奖时，我们穿的却是外国的阿迪达斯。\n\n不仅是阿迪达斯，早在1984年洛杉矶奥运会，中国第一次派出规模庞大的代表团参加奥运，也是第一次拿下奥运金牌时，中国代表团所穿的，也是一家美国的品牌，耐克。\n\n中国的运动员，为什么要穿美国品牌？\n\n其实阿迪达斯与耐克们的目的很简单：通过赞助奥运，赞助运动员，将本就在中国建厂，依靠中国廉价劳动力成本生产出的鞋服，以“阿迪达斯”“耐克”品牌的名义，再次卖到中国市场。\n\n从奥运到世锦赛，从专业比赛到表演赛，高水平的运动竞技，一直是各大运动品牌实力最大的代言。\n\n到了十四年后，当年看台上沉默的丁世忠终于吐了一口气，当奥运会再次在中国北京举办，他所创办的中国品牌安踏，已经彻底取代海外洋品牌，成为中国代表团官方合作伙伴，并为短道速滑、速度滑冰、钢架雪车等12支国家队打造比赛装备，还提供了上万工作人员、志愿者的制服。\n\n这并不是一朝一夕间的突然爆发，其实早在过去的十多年间，安踏为代表的中国运动品牌就已经连续多年赞助中国的国家队与各大运动赛事，并在世界级的赛场与耐克、阿迪达斯一较高下。\n\n而这14年间的北京奥运循环中，故事的主角也并不止安踏与丁世忠：2008-2022，从阿迪赞助，到身穿安踏领奖；从穿耐克有面子，到心疼鸿星尔克；中国运动品牌的潮水流向，早已悄然发生了天翻地覆的变化。\n\n再将时间周期拉得更久，你会发现，三十年间，这群晋江起家的中国运动品牌，他们从无到有，从弱到强，从一双公版走天下，到穿越无人区，讲述中国故事，这不仅是中国运动品牌的崛起，更是整个中国制造的逆袭范式。\n\n1\n\n1991~2007，草莽时代，\n\n国力伴随下的初次崛起\n\n如果回顾1991-2007年中国运动品牌蓬勃发展的黄金年代，你会发现，那是一个群体特征明显，但个体特性模糊的草莽年代。\n\n如果对这一时期的中国运动品牌群体进行总结，你会发现，低成本+大市场+奥运营销+天价广告，几乎是他们共同的发展范式。无论是曾经的行业龙头李宁，抑或是如今的行业第一安踏。\n\n在那个年代里，中国运动品牌崛起的深层次共性，其实都在于中国市场的低成本与大市场属性。\n\n那时，有人做过一个测算：\n\n在需求端，全球发达国家平均每人拥有的运动鞋数量至少在3-4双，而当时的拥有十多亿人口的中国，每人平均的运动鞋拥有量却不足0.5双；这是一个超级蓝海市场；\n\n而在供给端：当时的中国人，平均月工资不到500元，一双运动鞋则动辄可以卖出几十甚至百元的价格，庞大的劳动力红利，将带来中国运动鞋生产制造的高速发展。\n\n需求与供给两头的高速增长，让仅仅在晋江一个城市，最辉煌时，大大小小的制鞋厂，一度高达三千家，并诞生了361°、乔丹、特步、匹克、鸿星尔克等等日后知名的运动品牌，巅峰时，也一度包揽了全球近五分之一的运动鞋生产。\n\n安踏也不例外，从石头与毛毡搭起的厂房，配合几把剪刀、锤子与缝纫机做起的简易工厂开始，到1991年正式成立品牌“安踏”，凭借着低廉的成本与对品质的把控，仅仅六年时间，安踏就已经在1997年的中国拥有近两千家门店，并成为一众晋江鞋商中的佼佼者。\n\n成本与市场的优势之外，当年的中国运动品牌，还迫切需要从成本驱动转为品牌溢价驱动，因此奥运营销+天价广告，又成为了他们的另一大时代共性。\n\n当年在国内，带起这一阵风的是安踏。那是1999年，当年利润仅仅400万的安踏，在创始人丁世忠的力排众议下，决定花80万天价，敲定了与自己长相颇为相似的世界冠军孔令辉代言。此后，安踏又再次大手一挥，砸下多半年的利润，300万巨款，将孔令辉代言安踏的内容，在黄金时段的央视，广告循环播放。\n\n赌上几乎一整年利润的丁世忠，在次年，就随着孔令辉的悉尼奥运夺金，看着公司销售额一举突破十亿，增长高达十倍。\n\n不过，安踏的套路，也很快被一众晋江同乡学到：匹克在同期赞助了上海八一篮球队；特步先后签约当年大火的谢霆锋推进“体娱营销”；361°则签下中国国家羽毛球队，在雅典奥运期间砸下4000万元打广告。CCTV-5体育频道，也因2006年世界杯期间近1/4的广告时间都在播放晋江运动企业广告，而被调侃称作“晋江频道”。\n\n辉煌的顶点出现在2007年7月，那时安踏在港交所上市，融资额度超35亿港元，一举创下国内运动品牌的融资额之最，此后特步、361°等企业相继跟上，创造了一个属于中国运动品牌的黄金年代。\n\n只是那时，站在辉煌的顶点，面对一模一样的打法，长相都高度相似的产品，谁也回答不出来一个问题，这是时代塑造出的安踏与晋江鞋帮，还是安踏与一众晋江鞋帮通过努力与汗水换来的时代。\n\n2\n\n2008~2013，产能扩张背后，\n\n这一次的降雨，下一次的洪水\n\n转折发生了，2008年，这一年对日后的中国运动品牌来说，是一个特殊的起点，在这前后发生了两件事。\n\n第一件，北京奥运举办的历史机遇，带来中国运动市场爆发。\n\n数据统计，2008年的中国体育用品的行业规模已经高达1039亿。有记者走上街头，对一家街头的小店主进行采访，震惊的发现，一家普通的门店，即使一半卖安踏等品牌球鞋，一半卖贴牌产品，也依旧年流水百万。\n\n第二件，市场的赚钱效应之下，中国品牌开启了疯狂的高速扩张。\n\n以李宁为首，安踏、匹克、361°、特步、喜得龙各大品牌旗下门店相继突破万家。仅2010年一年，李宁新增门店就高达666家，而匹克的更是创下了一年1018家门店新增的奇迹。\n\n然而，历史机遇与高速发展的共振，万店齐开却并未带来理想的回报。如果说，1991-2007蛮荒年代的扩张是久旱的降雨，那么2008-2011年的非理性扩张，带来的显然是一场史诗级大洪水的预告。\n\n2012年年初，各家企业交出2011年的财务数据：匹克存货4.21亿元，增幅25.67%；中国动向集团存货为4.04亿元，上升57.81%，当时国产第一的李宁，更是存货11.33亿元，同比上升40.57%；\n\n清理存货成为了未来几年里国产运动品牌的主要目标，那个年代遍布大街小巷的工厂店、折扣店就是最好的证明。\n\n在这场大扩张中走的相对保守的安踏，也在此时感受到了丝丝寒意，2013年2月25日，其创始人丁世忠发微博：“闭着眼睛都挣钱的时代结束了，深耕时代来临了，笑到最后拼的是实力、拼的是团队、拼的是观念、拼的是管理。”\n\n他开始思考一个问题，中国的运动品牌，从无到有，从弱到强，依靠的一直都是庞大的人口、低廉的成本、高速发展的市场，这是中国市场的优势，但同时也是三寸：低成本、快扩张带来的恶性竞争，已经在过去几年间让行业尝尽了苦头。\n\n那么安踏要如何惯性生存，成为相比李宁、相比特步，甚至相比耐克，也同样“独一无二”的安踏？丁世忠做了两大方面的变革：第一销售变革，第二管理变革。\n\n销售上：安踏把大区加盟商批发订货改成单店订货，从经销商手中收回 80% 的门店；并加强供应链管理，严格要求零售标准在每家门店执行。\n\n管理上：安踏从以前的“人治”，变成数字治理，引入ERP\\SAP等软件，用数字化的模式，实现实时管理，减少管理流程，降低管理费用。\n\n也正是靠着这些变革，2011-2014几年间，国产鞋服王牌宝座，开始从李宁时代，正式向安踏时代倾斜。到2015年，安踏更是一举成为中国第一家销售额突破百亿的运动品牌。\n\n3\n\n2014~2022，国产运动品牌，\n\n从追赶到超越\n\n2014年正式成为国产第一后，安踏所面临的时代命题再次改变，如何突破面目模糊的国产品牌的想象，成为世界范围内独一无二的运动品牌巨头？\n\n前路艰险，结果未知，对手是从前一度仰望的耐克、阿迪等一众国际一线品牌。安踏所面临的一个残酷现实是，当你对手的距离很远时，要做追赶，你还有来自这些领先者的先进经验可以学习；但是当你已经逐渐与他们身位靠近，用老的套路打败他们就开始变得不现实。\n\n对此，安踏的董事长丁世忠，在安踏成立的20余年里，这位掌舵者曾多次对外公开表态：“不做中国的耐克，要做世界的安踏！”\n\n成为全世界“独一份”的安踏，盯着这个目标，丁世忠将变革的思路拆解成两步：第一，是技术的超越，第二，是精准的营销定位。\n\n我们先看看技术。\n\n在刚刚落幕的2022北京冬奥会上，朝气蓬勃的“青蛙公主”谷爱凌凭借出色的表现，摘得自由式滑雪女子大跳台金牌、自由式滑雪坡面障碍技巧银牌以及自由式滑雪女子U型场地技巧金牌，两金一银。\n\n陪着她一起完成“向左偏转双周偏轴转体1620度加安全抓板”技术动作的，征服首钢大跳台比赛的，正是来自安踏的龙纹战袍。\n\n自由式滑雪，运动员常年身处户外雪场，为了保持更好的运动状态，发挥更好的实力，运动员需要在防风保暖的前提下，还能保持身体的干燥舒适，与此同时，也要求比赛服在剪裁上，能够做到量身定制，充分适应人体结构，为运动员带来更好的运动状态。\n\n而谷爱凌在坡面障碍技巧和女子U型场地技巧比赛中穿的这件红色龙纹战袍，则一次性集合了五大科技元素：做到了防风防水透湿、抗撕耐磨、轻盈保暖、立体裁剪、龙纹印花，集科技与美学、中华文化于一身。\n\n当然，不止是谷爱凌的龙纹战袍，本次北京冬奥会中，中国单板滑雪运动员苏翊鸣、短道速滑队，钢架雪车队、冰壶队等一众优秀的运动员，他们所穿着使用的比赛装备同样来自国产，来自安踏，而这些看似普通的装备背后，每一件其实都有十足的科技含量。\n\n仅仅拿短道速滑比赛服来说，对轻薄、透气、安全、减阻的要求堪称变态。为了减小阻力，安踏比赛服使用了四大减阻科技，与此同时，为了帮助运动员更高水平的发挥，比赛服又要用高弹面料包裹运动员，做到无缝贴合，保证穿着舒适、不影响发力、减少运动员发力瞬间的速度损耗。\n\n而面临短道速滑的运动以及竞争对手的“特性”，比赛服除了舒适且能降风阻之外，还必须特别注意安全性，以避免对手的冰刀在比赛中割伤运动员。\n\n为此，安踏采用了Dyneema防切割技术，比赛服的防切割强度是钢丝的15倍，普通剪刀根本划不破，而且还突破了传统的局部防护，使用了360°全身防切割技术，安全性大幅提高。\n\n而针对每位运动员本身，安踏还会根据其运动习惯、肌肉线条做到版型的优化，经过多次版型调整，做到完全的量身定制。\n\n这些是普通人看得到的“黑科技”，而在看不到的地方，却藏着安踏不为人知的十年。\n\n实际上，在更早的2008年北京奥运会之前，安踏就曾建设国内首个，也是唯一一家国家级运动科学实验室。随后，安踏在美国、日本、韩国、意大利等国家陆续建立了全球五大设计研发中心，招募了来自18个国家和地区、超200名国际顶级设计研发专家。\n\n为了支撑庞大的研发团队，安踏10年间累计投入约30亿元资金，如此庞大的研发支出，在业内也是独一份。\n\n技术的革新与领先，是安踏独一无二的根本，而精准的营销定位则让安踏的独一无二，进一步被普通人所理解。\n\n在本届北京冬奥会期间，《卧虎藏龙》《大明宫词》《橘子红了》《红楼梦》等经典作品的美术指导叶锦添与安踏联手，设计了中国代表队室内领奖服。\n\n领奖服整体以汉字“中”字为灵感来源，以白色为基础色，中轴火龙一样的红色为辅，象征中国体育精神。这一设计，在冬奥期间，火速引起了广泛讨论，人们惊叹于含蓄、深沉的中式审美，竟与热情、有力的运动精神，做到了完美的融合。\n\n与此同时，安踏的冠军系列产品，也随着冬奥周期，而受到了用户的广泛欢迎。\n\n当然，美只是表象，美的根源则在于对中国式审美的坚守与对中国人性情的深入洞察。\n\n众所周知，奥运主题营销，会潜移默化地影响用户的认知。1996年在亚特兰大奥运会上，没有做官方赞助的耐克，却因为短跑运动员迈克尔·约翰逊穿着耐克的金色的跑鞋，受到巨大关注，张扬的金色跑鞋本身，其实也是美式文化所宣扬推崇的，也因此备受欢迎。\n\n但中国企业的营销不能照搬耐克，根本在于，耐克的营销本质是西方审美与价值观的折射，与中国的审美，与中华文化不完全一致。\n\n如果仔细观察，我们会发现，在不少欧美运动品牌的广告中，流于形式的Girl Power、LGBT群体、肤色平等都是重要的表现话题。当然，我们不是对这些价值观进行评判，而是耐克这种过于刻意的“谄媚”，其实连美国人自己都无所适从。美剧《投行风云》就直接在剧中讽刺耐克，“I’m Nike.I pretend to care about Black people. ”\n\n与耐克形成鲜明的对比，安踏在旗帜鲜明地喊出“爱运动 中国有安踏”后，也以实际行动大方展示着“爱运动”“爱中国”的理念：无论是与叶锦添联手大方展示中国元素；还是，在新疆长绒棉事件中，成为最早立场坚定地站中国长绒棉的中国企业之一；再或者是签约爱运动的优质偶像王一博、天才运动少女谷爱凌，深入洞察Z时代的审美以及潮流。\n\n安踏为突破营销无人区的中国品牌，交出了一份满分参考卷。\n\n数据更能说明一切。\n\n先来看看两年前的市场格局。在2020年，阿迪达斯和耐克仍占据我国运动品牌大部分市场。参照欧睿统计，2020年运动品牌的市占率榜单上，耐克以25.6%的数据高居榜首，阿迪达斯紧随其后为17.4%，国内龙头品牌安踏以15.4%的市场份额位列第三，李宁、特步和361度分别为6.7%、4.7%和2.6%。\n\n而自2021年以来，国内品牌开始集中突破海外品牌的包围圈。据天猫数据显示，2021年1-7月的运动鞋服领域，安踏总流水超过耐克、阿迪达斯，位居第一，这也是中国品牌的首次登顶。\n\n进入2022年，国产品牌逆势上扬，海外品牌萎靡与下滑的发展格局，驾驶变得更加清晰。据摩根斯坦利近期公布的数据显示，仅2022年1月份，安踏、李宁、耐克和阿迪达斯几个品牌，同比增长率分别为：91%、88%、78%和68%。\n\n谁更受中国用户的喜爱，结果不言自明。\n\n这一趋势在电商渠道更为明显。以天猫平台为例，运动服饰品牌的成交额，在2月份呈现出显著分化，耐克同比降低32%，阿迪达斯同比降低27%；而国产品牌安踏则逆势上涨，同比增幅达35%。\n\n自此，海外运动服饰品牌不再是打不败的神话。而中国运动品牌也依靠科技与品牌力量引领，完成了从二十年前面目模糊的高速发展，到如今世界范围内独树一帜的进化。\n\n4\n\n从面目模糊到引领，运动品牌的\n\n逆袭路，也是中国制造的范式\n\n回顾过去三十年，我们可以发现，中国运动品牌的发展可以分为三个明确的阶段。\n\n第一阶段，1991-2007，草莽时代，以晋江鞋服企业为代表，尽管缺乏明显的独特性，但依旧可以靠着中国的产业优势，一路快速发展；\n\n第二阶段，2008-2013，大逃杀阶段，经过近二十年的高速发展，由于产能过剩、被海外品牌降维打击、缺乏品牌能力等因素影响，安踏为代表的企业，开始了营销与管理的改革，完成了第一阶段的淘汰与转型；\n\n第三阶段，2014-2022，中国企业开始实现对海外品牌的逆袭；完成了产业从依靠中国资源优势，到展示中国科技力量与文化魅力的转变。\n\n在这三十年中，中国产业完成了从落后到领先的跨越，而安踏也从一家20多人的小作坊，到如今创造超20万人就业机会，市值400多亿美金，中国第一、世界第三的体育用品集团。\n\n这一过程，中国品牌用了不到三十年，而耐克用了46年，阿迪达斯用了68年。\n\n当然，这一过程，不仅是安踏或者中国运动品牌的经历回顾，更是“国产替代”浪潮下，芯片领域的华为、新能源领域的比亚迪等中国品牌对外资的逆袭一个典型范式。\n\n其中既有民族自信觉醒，消费者理念转变，对国产品牌认可度提升等客观因素，也有国产品牌在产品质量、设计创新、渠道渗透等多方面竞争力飞跃的主观原因。\n\n这三十年的变革中，无数像安踏、像华为、像蔚来、像中芯国际一样的企业，在享受了时代的红利后，正在深刻改变着一个时代潮水的流向。，总字数控制在2000-3000字，具体要求如下\n1.

The report should be structured according to the following outline: 1. Background introduction, including market environment, target client characteristics, and an overview of the research data; 2.

The target word count of the report is approximately 3000 words, ensuring that the content is comprehensive, with language that is concise and organized. Simple data visualizations and charts may be included when necessary to strengthen the explanation.\nFor background information on the target audience (such as the typical characteristics and needs of high-net-worth clients), please refer to: **Background Introduction of the Target Audience (such as typical characteristics and needs of high-net-worth clients):**  \n**Typical Characteristics:**  \nThe following is an in-depth analysis and comparison of high-net-worth clients' financial characteristics in 2023, revealing new trends in the ten dimensions of risk preferences, product selection, investment decisions, and global asset allocation.\n\n1. **Risk Preference of High-Net-Worth Clients**  \nIn 2023, the risk preference of high-net-worth clients significantly declined, reflecting their concerns about economic uncertainty and market volatility.  \nIn the current economic environment, the financial needs of high-net-worth clients remain strong; however, their tolerance for risk has notably decreased.  \nThis change is mainly attributed to concerns about economic slowdown and global economic uncertainty, as well as the defaults faced by many financial institutions' fixed-income products during the financial de-leveraging process.  \nMoreover, the persistent sluggish state of capital markets has also led to significant value drawdowns in some historical investment products.\n\n2. **Product Selection Preferences**  \nHigh-net-worth clients tend to prefer medium-return fixed-income products with quotes, indicating their pursuit of stable investment returns while maintaining risk control.  \nIn terms of product selection, high-net-worth clients show a preference for medium-return quoted fixed-income products, reflecting their emphasis on risk control. Private bank deposits, insurance, structured products such as snowball, asset allocation plans, and equity products follow closely.  \nDue to frequent issues with fixed-income products, even in cases where financial institutions offer rigid redemption, high-net-worth clients have become more cautious about traditional non-standard and high-yield fixed-income products.  \nAdditionally, due to poor experiences with primary market products, their interest in such investments has decreased.  \nIf financial products experience volatility, or if the quoted fixed-income products heavily promoted by private banks encounter credit risks, especially platform-type assets, high-net-worth clients are expected to continue shifting assets into deposits.\n\n3. **Investment Decision Influences**  \nHigh-net-worth clients' investment decisions are deeply influenced by their past investment experiences, making them more likely to adopt rational and cautious investment strategies during market fluctuations.  \nWhen facing market volatility, high-net-worth clients may show a tendency to chase rising prices, but compared to regular retail clients, their investment behavior is more rational and cautious.  \nDuring the capital market fluctuations from 2021 to 2023, high-net-worth clients exhibited a \"chase the rise but don't sell off the decline\" stable investment attitude.\n\n4. **Preference for Historical High-Performance Products**  \nAlthough there is a decline in the enthusiasm for star products and funds, high-net-worth clients still tend to invest in products with a good historical performance, reflecting their focus on performance momentum.  \nHigh-net-worth clients have shown strong interest in products with good past performance, such as municipal bonds, collective trust funds, snowball, quantitative hedging, DMA, and dividend-style funds.  \nIn equity investments, they prefer quantitative investments over subjective ones.  \nCompared to the past, high-net-worth clients are more cautious in their financial allocations, placing higher demands on information transparency, investment transparency, and investment logic.\n\n5. **Preference for Comprehensive Financial Solutions**  \nHigh-net-worth clients prefer comprehensive financial solutions that provide a complete financial planning service, rather than simply recommending single products.  \nHowever, there is a lack of understanding about the market, assets, products, and allocations, and financial institutions' ability to offer investment education and accompanying services has not fully met client demands. This raises higher expectations for financial institutions' service models and solutions.\n\n6. **Rationality in Investment Behavior**  \nHigh-net-worth clients' investment behavior rationality is proportional to their wealth level and investment experience, revealing the significant role of wealth in shaping investment behavior.  \nWealth levels not only represent clients' ability to understand society as a whole and their ownership of resources, but they are also an important indicator of their ability to access and enrich financial services resources.  \nTherefore, wealthier clients tend to demonstrate more rational investment behavior.\n\n7. **Focus on Professionalism in Financial Institutions**  \nWhen selecting financial institutions and investment advisors, high-net-worth clients place more emphasis on professionalism and product allocation ability, rather than solely on service quality or brand influence.  \nHigh-net-worth clients prioritize the institution's professionalism and product allocation ability, not just service, branding, or marketing activities.  \nThis may be due to the small yield differences in fixed-income products, higher safety requirements, and significant differences in investment advice and product allocation provided by different institutions and investment advisors under the backdrop of net value and asset volatility.\n\n8. **Regional Differences in Investment Behavior**  \nRegional differences play a significant role in the investment behavior of high-net-worth clients, with different economic development levels and financial maturity influencing investment preferences and behavior.  \nHigh-net-worth clients in the western and northern regions have relatively low acceptance of net value-based assets. They prefer high-yield fixed-income assets with rigid redemption, thus being greatly affected by asset issues in recent years.  \nIn contrast, high-net-worth clients in coastal developed cities (excluding Shandong and Tianjin) and Beijing, especially those in the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta regions, are more experienced in investing, have higher tolerance for market fluctuations, and possess a more advanced understanding of credit risks.\n\n9. **Demand for Overseas Asset Allocation**  \nIn the face of global economic uncertainty, high-net-worth clients have significantly increased their demand for overseas asset allocation, diversifying their assets through international financial centers such as Hong Kong and Singapore.  \nIn the uncertain environment, high-net-worth clients have shown increased demand for overseas asset allocation to reduce risk through diversified investments.  \nThe high coupon rates of overseas fixed-income products (nominal interest rates) and the continued rise of overseas capital markets are the main factors driving this increased demand.\n\n10. **Family Legacy Needs**  \nFamily legacy demands are urgent among high-net-worth clients, but the younger generation shows relatively less interest in taking over family businesses. They are more inclined to explore financial investments and emerging industries. Meanwhile, family offices still face challenges in providing comprehensive and professional investment allocation services.  \nAlthough there is a strong demand for family legacy planning, the younger generation is less interested in taking over the family business. They are more inclined to financial investments and show a keen interest in emerging industries and new opportunities. However, they generally lack investment experience.  \nHigh-net-worth clients have a common need for family trusts, not only due to legal isolation and inheritance requirements but also because family trusts have relatively low surface fees.  \nCurrently, many entrepreneurs or ultra-high-net-worth clients have established family offices, significantly enhancing their ability to access information on asset allocation. However, in general, family offices in China still have shortcomings in providing comprehensive and professional investment allocation capabilities.\n\n**Demand:**  \n1. **Preservation and Growth of Assets:**  \nThis is one of the most concerned demands for high-net-worth clients. They expect to achieve stable wealth growth through professional investment strategies and high-quality investment products. They are more cautious in risk control, pursuing optimal returns within acceptable risk limits.  \n\n2. **Personalized Custom Services:**  \nAs each high-net-worth client's financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance differ, they hope financial institutions can tailor exclusive financial solutions based on their specific circumstances.  \n\n3. **Global Asset Allocation:**  \nHigh-net-worth clients often have a broad vision and a willingness for diversified asset allocation. They wish to seek quality investment opportunities worldwide to diversify risk and enhance overall asset returns.  \nIn addition, high-net-worth clients also have significant needs in other areas, such as:  \n\n- **Health, Retirement, and Education:**  \nThese are also crucial topics for high-net-worth clients. They usually plan comprehensive health insurance, retirement plans, and education funds for their families and themselves.  \n\n- **Risk Management:**  \nHigh-net-worth clients also have high demands in risk management. They hope financial institutions can provide comprehensive risk management services, including debt risk, tax risk, investment risk, marriage risk, and accident risk, among others.  \n\nIn conclusion, the demands of high-net-worth clients are multifaceted, including core needs such as the preservation and growth of assets, personalized custom services, and global asset allocation, as well as other significant needs such as health, retirement, education, and risk management. As wealth management experts, I will tailor the most suitable wealth management plan for each client based on their specific circumstances to meet their all-around needs.", "criteria": [{"name": "Structural_Adherence_and_Organization", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the specified three-part structure and maintains logical flow within each section while meeting the 3000-word requirement.", "1-2": "Structure is chaotic, sections are mixed or missing, severe organizational issues, significantly under/over word count.", "3-4": "Basic structure present but poorly organized, sections lack clear boundaries, notable deviation from word count.", "5-6": "Follows basic structure with some organizational inconsistencies, reasonable word count but some sections imbalanced.", "7-8": "Well-organized with clear section demarcation, good flow between topics, appropriate word count with balanced sections.", "9-10": "Exemplary organization with seamless transitions, perfect adherence to structure, optimal word count with ideally balanced sections."}, {"name": "Data_Analysis_and_Interpretation", "criteria_description": "Assesses the depth and accuracy of research data analysis, including the effectiveness of data visualization and the quality of insights derived.", "1-2": "Superficial or incorrect analysis, missing key findings, poor or missing data visualization.", "3-4": "Basic analysis with limited insights, weak connection between data and conclusions, inadequate visualizations.", "5-6": "Adequate analysis with some meaningful insights, basic but relevant visualizations, some gaps in interpretation.", "7-8": "Strong analysis with clear insights, effective data visualization, good connection between data and recommendations.", "9-10": "Exceptional analysis with profound insights, superior data visualization, compelling data-driven narrative."}, {"name": "Target_Audience_Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the content addresses high-net-worth client characteristics and needs, maintaining appropriate professional tone and depth.", "1-2": "Content misaligned with target audience, inappropriate tone, fails to address key client characteristics.", "3-4": "Partially aligned content, inconsistent professional tone, superficial understanding of client needs.", "5-6": "Generally appropriate content and tone, adequate understanding of client characteristics.", "7-8": "Well-aligned content, consistent professional tone, strong grasp of client needs and characteristics.", "9-10": "Perfectly tailored content, exemplary professional tone, comprehensive understanding of target audience."}, {"name": "Strategy_Optimization_Quality", "criteria_description": "Assesses the practicality, specificity, and comprehensiveness of recommended optimization strategies across product, marketing, and service aspects.", "1-2": "Vague or impractical recommendations, missing key strategic elements, poor actionability.", "3-4": "Basic recommendations lacking detail, limited strategic scope, questionable feasibility.", "5-6": "Adequate recommendations with some specific measures, reasonable strategic coverage.", "7-8": "Detailed, practical recommendations across all required areas, good strategic depth.", "9-10": "Exceptional, comprehensive strategies with specific, actionable measures and innovative solutions."}, {"name": "Business_Insight_and_Market_Context", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the demonstration of market understanding, business acumen, and integration of current market environment in the analysis.", "1-2": "Poor market understanding, lacks business insight, missing crucial market context.", "3-4": "Limited market awareness, superficial business insights, weak contextual integration.", "5-6": "Adequate market understanding, basic business insights, reasonable contextual framework.", "7-8": "Strong market awareness, clear business insights, well-integrated market context.", "9-10": "Outstanding market expertise, profound business insights, masterful integration of market context."}]}

Below is a detailed explanation of the relevant legal provisions:\n\n1. **Network security provisions**  \n   1.1 **Responsibility of individuals and organizations using the internet**:  \n   According to Article 46 of the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, any individual or organization must take responsibility for their actions when using the internet. They must not establish websites, communication groups, or other platforms for fraudulent activities, teaching criminal methods, making or selling prohibited items, controlled items, or engaging in other illegal or criminal activities, nor can they use the internet to release information related to such activities.  \n   1.2 **Management responsibility of network operators**:  \n   According to Article 47 of the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, network operators should strengthen the management of information published by their users. If they discover information that is prohibited from being published or transmitted by laws or administrative regulations, they must immediately stop transmission, take measures to eliminate it, prevent further spread, retain relevant records, and report to the relevant authorities.  \n   1.3 **Security requirements for electronic information transmission and application software**:  \n   According to Article 48 of the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, any electronic information transmitted or application software provided by individuals or organizations must not contain malicious programs or include information that is prohibited by laws or administrative regulations from being published or transmitted. Violators will be held legally responsible under Article 60 of this law.  \n\n2. **Financial order maintenance provisions**  \n   2.1 **Punishment for illegal public deposit solicitation**:  \n   According to Article 176 of the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China*, those who illegally solicit public deposits or engage in disguised forms of public deposit solicitation, disturbing the financial order, will face a prison sentence of up to three years or detention, and/or fines. Those with significant amounts or other severe circumstances will face harsher punishments.  \n   2.2 **Punishment for illegal fundraising**:  \n   According to Article 192 of the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China*, those who illegally raise funds with the intent of unlawful possession, using fraudulent methods, and raising a large amount of money, will face a prison sentence of 3 to 7 years, along with fines. If the amount is enormous or there are other serious circumstances, the person may face a longer prison sentence or even life imprisonment, as well as fines or confiscation of property.\n\n3. **Summary**  \n   The Ministry of Public Security's regulations on internet finance are primarily focused on maintaining network security and financial order. Through relevant provisions in the *Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China*, the behaviors of individuals and organizations on the internet are regulated, and the management responsibilities of network operators are clearly defined. At the same time, the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China* clearly stipulates penalties for financial crimes such as illegal public deposit solicitation and illegal fundraising. These legal provisions together form the legal foundation for the Ministry of Public Security's supervision and crackdown on criminal activities in internet finance.\n\n**Research Report on Stock Market User Behavior**  \nThe report shows that the pace at which individual investors are entering the A-share market continues to accelerate. Currently, the number of individual investors in the A-share market has exceeded 175 million. This means that one in every ten people in China has opened an A-share account. However, using this number to represent the number of people participating in investments is not entirely accurate, as many of these accounts are inactive.  \nMen account for 78%, and women account for 22%. Men remain the main force in A-share investments, with the male-to-female ratio around 8:2, which is quite similar to our daily experience. Individuals between 24 and 30 years old account for nearly 30%, while those under 24 who have money are relatively rare, and those with money do not necessarily invest in stocks. People aged 30-40 make up 36%, and those over 40 account for about 25%. This means that individuals in the 30-40 age range, generally middle-aged, are the main force behind stock market investments. This group tends to have stable careers and families, some spare money, and some financial knowledge, and they aim to prevent their money from losing value by investing to earn profits.  \nInvestors are getting younger, and their educational backgrounds are improving. Among investors born after 1990, 50% have a bachelor's degree or higher. Among investors born in the 1980s, this percentage is 44%. Among investors born in the 1970s, the proportion is 38%. Meanwhile, nearly half of investors born in the 1950s have a high school education or lower.  \nInvestors from first-tier and super-first-tier cities account for 69%. Cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou, as well as Chengdu, are the top five cities in terms of investor distribution. Even Hangzhou, which has risen to a new first-tier city, ranks fourth.  \n26% of investors have less than 100,000 yuan, 30% fall into the 100,000-300,000 yuan range, and 15% have more than 1 million yuan. 28% of households are willing to allocate 10%-30% of their assets for A-share investment. 23% of households are willing to allocate 30%-50% for investment. 13% of households are willing to invest 70% of their assets, which suggests a high-risk, high-reward approach. However, this is not recommended for the average investor. It is always better to invest within one's financial means and create a solid asset allocation plan.  \nA-shares, mutual funds, real estate, and bank savings are the top four investment channels for investors. 41% of people are willing to invest in A-shares, 15% are willing to buy mutual funds, 9% want to invest in real estate, and 8% are interested in bank savings. According to interviews, 43% of post-90s investors prefer mutual funds. In contrast, investors born in the 1950s prefer bank savings-based financial products. This reflects the different growing environments across generations. Older generations tend to prefer conservative savings, while younger people are more aggressive and confident in managing their wealth.  \nOver 60% of investors had positive returns in 2020. Only 12.5% experienced losses of more than 20%.  \nOnly 24% of investors are willing to hold stocks for more than six months. About 30% can only stick with their investments for 1-3 months, and 34% of people trade stocks frequently within a month. This shows that A-share investors have not yet developed good investment habits. Many are more focused on short-term trades.  \nMore than 70% of investors have not sought paid investment consultations. Only 12% would pay for investment education or professional advice. This indicates that most of the A-share investment market is dominated by self-directed investors, creating significant opportunities for institutions and professional investors to profit.", "criteria": [{"name": "Market_Analysis_Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how thoroughly the response analyzes the market landscape, competitor dynamics, and target user demographics, incorporating provided research data effectively.", "1-2": "Minimal market analysis with no integration of provided research data, lacking competitor analysis and user demographics.", "3-4": "Basic market analysis with limited use of research data, superficial competitor analysis, and incomplete user profiling.", "5-6": "Adequate market analysis incorporating some research data, with standard competitor analysis and basic user profiling.", "7-8": "Comprehensive market analysis with good integration of research data, detailed competitor analysis, and thorough user profiling.", "9-10": "Exceptional market analysis with masterful integration of all research data, in-depth competitor analysis, and sophisticated user profiling."}, {"name": "Technical_Implementation_Detail", "criteria_description": "Assesses the depth and practicality of technical architecture, AI algorithms, and system design specifications.", "1-2": "Vague technical details with no concrete implementation plans or architectural specifications.", "3-4": "Basic technical outline with limited implementation details and incomplete architectural planning.", "5-6": "Adequate technical specifications with standard implementation plans and basic architectural design.", "7-8": "Detailed technical planning with comprehensive implementation strategies and well-structured architecture.", "9-10": "Exceptional technical detail with sophisticated implementation plans, innovative solutions, and robust architecture."}, {"name": "Regulatory_Compliance_Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the plan incorporates and addresses regulatory requirements and compliance considerations from provided policy documents.", "1-2": "No consideration of regulatory requirements or compliance issues.", "3-4": "Limited acknowledgment of regulations with minimal integration into the product plan.", "5-6": "Basic incorporation of regulatory requirements with standard compliance measures.", "7-8": "Thorough integration of regulatory requirements with comprehensive compliance planning.", "9-10": "Exceptional handling of regulatory compliance with detailed implementation strategies and risk mitigation."}, {"name": "Operational_Strategy_Viability", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the practicality and completeness of operational plans, marketing strategies, and revenue models.", "1-2": "Unrealistic or missing operational strategies with no clear revenue model.", "3-4": "Basic operational plans with weak marketing strategies and unclear revenue generation.", "5-6": "Standard operational framework with adequate marketing plans and basic revenue model.", "7-8": "Well-developed operational strategy with strong marketing plans and clear revenue streams.", "9-10": "Comprehensive operational planning with innovative marketing approaches and robust revenue models."}, {"name": "Content_Completeness_and_Length", "criteria_description": "Assesses whether all required sections are covered adequately and meet the 5000-word requirement while maintaining quality.", "1-2": "Significantly under word count with multiple missing sections.", "3-4": "Below word requirement with some sections inadequately covered.", "5-6": "Meets minimum word count with all sections covered basically.", "7-8": "Exceeds word requirement with thorough coverage of all sections.", "9-10": "Well over word requirement with comprehensive, high-quality coverage of all sections."}]}

However, starting in 2000, the digital camera market grew rapidly and showed a concentrated explosion trend. During this high-growth period, digital companies like Sony, Canon, Samsung, and Nikon flooded into the camera field, with their interchangeable advantages creating a strong impact on the traditional film industry. That year, the global digital imaging market nearly doubled, and the demand for global color film began to show a turning point, which then started to decline rapidly at a rate of 10% per year.  \nAt this time, Kodak's decision-makers made a wrong decision—they continued to focus on traditional film. As a company with an absolute share in the traditional film industry, Kodak's decision-makers did not want to see a too rapid development of their digital business. After the \"98 Agreement,\" Kodak made large investments in China, with huge production capacity and scale that they couldn't digest in time, and they couldn't afford to neglect the traditional film business. They were hesitant and complicated in their approach to the new round of digital transformation. In 2000, Kodak's digital business revenue was roughly the same as in 1999, accounting for only 21% of its total turnover.  \nIn contrast, Fuji, with fewer choices, was more focused on its digital business transformation. As early as 1995, Fuji established Suzhou Fuji Film Imaging Machine Co., Ltd. in Suzhou, focusing on high-tech industries. In 1997, Fuji began producing digital cameras. Fuji, a company built on technology, had many core technologies in the digital camera field. In 2000, Fuji Film jointly invested with the Chinese Academy of Printing Science and Technology to establish Fuji Starlight Co., Ltd. Together, they developed and launched a series of high-quality PS plates (pre-coated photosensitive plates), which were widely used in China's printing industry. Fuji Starlight also cooperated with domestic companies to launch two high-speed laser plate-making machines with internationally leading technologies. Fuji's digital printing equipment became popular worldwide and significantly impacted traditional printing.  \nDuring this period, Kodak remained passive. It wasn't until March 2001 that Kodak launched its digital printing business in Shanghai. In October 2003, Kodak made a high-profile announcement of a 20-year cooperation agreement with Lucky Film, where Kodak exchanged approximately $100 million in cash and other assets for a 20% stake in Lucky Film. Kodak was still struggling with traditional film industry competitors.  \nBy 2002, a statistic clearly illustrated the situation: Kodak's digitalization rate was only about 25%, while Fuji had reached 60%. That year, a survey showed that 23 million American households owned a digital camera, an increase of 57% from the previous year. Meanwhile, Fuji's digital camera sales doubled from 2001, capturing 30% of the Japanese market and 20% of the global market.  \nAt this point, Kodak realized that the golden age of traditional film was gone forever. The market is cruel. Kodak's profit reports from 2000 to 2003 showed that the sales profit of Kodak's traditional imaging division dropped sharply from $14.3 billion in 2000 to $4.18 billion in 2003, a 71% decline.  \nCurrently, Fuji Film leads the world market in three major areas: TAC film for LCD display materials, lens assemblies for high-pixel camera phones, and color photo paper. This is closely related to Fuji's long-standing emphasis on technological development because Fuji has always believed that \"technological innovation is the core competitiveness of a company.\" In his 2008 New Year's speech to employees, President Fujio Mitarai stated that Fuji Film aims to become a \"company of continuous innovation and sustainable development\" in the 21st century.  \nIn contrast, Kodak: By the end of June 2009, Kodak discontinued film production, its efforts to promote Kodak photo stores were hindered, and its performance continued to decline (by the third quarter of 2009, Kodak had experienced four consecutive quarters of 20% revenue decline and four consecutive quarters of losses). People began to speculate whether Kodak would be acquired. Kodak first misjudged the future of digital photography and then failed to seize the opportunity to make a quick adjustment. As a result, it fell from being the leader in the imaging industry to an underdog, with a cost that could not be described as anything but deeply painful.", "criteria": [{"name": "Presentation_Structure_Adherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the script follows the required roadshow presentation structure, including all specified modules and their logical flow.", "1-2": "Missing multiple key sections, severely disorganized flow, lacks clear transitions between modules.", "3-4": "Contains most required sections but with poor organization, weak transitions, and inconsistent emphasis on key points.", "5-6": "Includes all required sections with adequate organization, though some transitions or section depths could be improved.", "7-8": "Well-structured with all required sections, strong transitions, and appropriate emphasis, with minor room for improvement.", "9-10": "Perfectly structured with all required sections, seamless transitions, and optimal emphasis on each module."}, {"name": "Patent_Case_Analysis_Quality", "criteria_description": "Assesses the depth and relevance of the patent case analysis, including market potential evaluation and profitability pathway details.", "1-2": "Superficial or missing patent case analysis, lacks concrete data and market insights.", "3-4": "Basic patent case presentation with limited market analysis and insufficient profitability discussion.", "5-6": "Adequate patent case analysis with reasonable market insights, though lacking some specific details.", "7-8": "Comprehensive patent case analysis with strong market insights and clear profitability pathways, minor details missing.", "9-10": "Exceptional patent case analysis with detailed market evaluation, concrete data, and thorough profitability analysis."}, {"name": "Industry_Context_Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively industry background and technological case studies are incorporated to enhance credibility.", "1-2": "Minimal or irrelevant industry context, lacks meaningful technological case studies.", "3-4": "Basic industry context with superficial case studies, limited connection to main arguments.", "5-6": "Adequate industry context and case studies, though some connections could be stronger.", "7-8": "Strong industry context with relevant case studies, well-integrated but missing minor details.", "9-10": "Exceptional integration of industry context and case studies, perfectly supporting main arguments."}, {"name": "Investor_Communication_Style", "criteria_description": "Assesses the appropriateness of communication style for an investor audience, including professionalism and persuasiveness.", "1-2": "Inappropriate style, lacks professionalism and persuasive elements.", "3-4": "Inconsistent style, mixed levels of professionalism, weak persuasive arguments.", "5-6": "Generally appropriate style with adequate professionalism and reasonable persuasion.", "7-8": "Professional style with strong persuasive elements, minor refinements needed.", "9-10": "Perfect investor-focused style, highly professional and persuasive throughout."}, {"name": "Content_Scope_and_Length", "criteria_description": "Evaluates whether the content meets the specified length requirements and maintains appropriate depth throughout.", "1-2": "Significantly outside word count range, severely imbalanced content depth.", "3-4": "Slightly outside word count range, inconsistent depth across sections.", "5-6": "Meets word count requirements but with some sections lacking proper depth.", "7-8": "Within word count range with generally good depth, minor balance issues.", "9-10": "Perfect length with optimal depth and balance across all sections."}]}

{"index": 680, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Biography", "query": "作为一名大学中文系的学生，需要为文学社的诗歌分享会准备一篇关于诗人顾城的传记演讲稿。希望以温和平实的口吻，结合自己对新诗的理解和感悟，重点描写顾城在新诗创作上的艺术成就、独特风格和重要作品。同时也要客观呈现他复杂的人生轨迹，包括童年、成长环境、婚姻关系等。行文要适合20岁左右的青年学生群体欣赏，可以适当加入一些个人对顾城诗作的解读和情感共鸣。演讲时长控制在15-20分钟为宜。\n文学评论家对顾城诗歌艺术特色的分析文章引用：文学评论家对顾城诗歌艺术特色的分析文章：    \n顾城的诗，每读一遍都有不同的感受。黑夜给了我黑色的眼晴，我却用它寻找光明。正如这首《一代人》，短短的两行诗句，却清晰地勾画了一群探索者的坚定形象。我暗叹诗人独特的想象，呈现在我们面前的仅仅是十几个字，字里行间却还有着看似简单实为复杂的意象。在顾城的诗作中，人们总能找到一种与众不同的感觉。\n    顾城诗歌的最大特点便是意象的呈现。而顾城诗歌的意象世界最常用的表现手法首先是象征隐喻法：这也是诗歌新艺术的中心，它打破了真实描写和直抒胸臆的传统表现手法，使诗人的抒情角度转移，诗中的象征从表面看上去毫无联系，也无所指，但深层却有无穷的意蕴，诗的感染力也就在于此，早期象征主义大师马拉美反复强调2“诗只能暗示，如直呼其名，诗的享受便减去四分这三”。是的，诗的魅力不体现直观和如实地描绘，也不是在证明什么，它总是在暗示什么，象征性的加以启迪也是现代诗的一个重要特点。象征手法与古典诗歌“由此至彼”，“言此意它”的比兴手法极其相近，从根本上说，象征也是一种比兴，或者比兴是象征的一种表现手法，比是求诗的形象化，兴是求诗的言外之意，所不同的是象征手法经常巧妙地隐去被比事物，诗歌主题也就呈现了多义性。例如开头出现的小诗《一代人》，它是由“黑夜”，“我”“黑色的眼睛”等感性形象构成的意象组合，它们既有其本身的客观意义，所代表的内在含义又都超越了这些词汇固有的客观意义，加上题目的指示，因而具有了强烈的象征性，即“黑夜”象征置于那一代人心灵上的阴影，眼睛”象征一代人探索的眼睛，双是渴望光明的眼睛，而诗中的“我”则象征着一代人。由此我们能够看出，诗歌象征的审美特性，实际上就是意象的一种内在的美学特性。\n    顾城诗歌的意象世界中的隐喻表现手法与象征一样也是具有其暗指性，通过一个非直接的比喻来使思或感觉具体化；通过隐喻创造的意象，诗人的情感往往藏得很深，我们最先接触到的仅仅是意象的直观世界，而要进一步体会“幕后”的心灵世界，需要一段路程。诸如他在《生命幻想曲》中这样写：让阳光的瀑布/洗黑我的皮肤…太阳是我的纤夫/它拉着我/用强光的绳索/·前一节里用“瀑布”来隐喻“阳光”，随之又用瀑布洗黑人的皮肤，来隐喻阳光晒黑我的皮肤，而皮肤被晒黑，原是一种健康美的标志，因此，它们之间复杂而又巧妙的隐喻结构所形成的意象正如一位意象研究者所说的：“两个视觉意象形成我们称之为视觉和弦的东西，并且合起来提示了一个与二者都不同的意象。”的确更妙地暗示出了诗人渴望于自己的生命在光明世界锻炼得更强壮这么一种健康的情调。后一节里，用“纤夫”来隐喻“太阳”，又用“绳索”来隐喻“强光”，用纤夫背着绳索我在逆流中前进，来暗示这一种昂扬的气概，光明的信念，鼓舞着生命，使他在任何险恶的困境中奋力前进。\n    顾城诗歌意象的第二种表现手法当属抽象变形手法了。\n    随着现代生活的进展，人们的鉴赏口味不断地转移，鉴赏周期也不断地缩短，艺术变形越来越多得受到重视。在某种意义上说：“没有变形就没有艺术”。西方现代派的艺术纲领宣称“准确描绘不一定是真实的”这和司空图所说的“离形得似\"真是不谋而合，而新诗潮关于意象的创造常常脱出古典主义的夸饰而致力于“变形”，直觉、幻觉、错觉，瞬间感觉印象很容易产生变形，而变形的关键则在于作者主观感受和客观真实的对立怎样巧妙地变成“无理之中的有理”。\n    例如诗人眼中脱落的叶子能够露出干燥的内脏，诗人眼中的美丽的口花竟然是一片血腥。诗人也照样可以把感觉外化出来，改变对事物原有状态的募写，比如：阳光象木浆样倾斜/浸在清凉的梦中。诗人意象的变形其实是诗人心态的体现，情绪的流露，就顾城而言，他的童年充满梦幻，而少年时代的他，梦幻被现实击碎，纯真的少年压抑了自己，面对文革中红海洋中的暴行，躁动和血腥味道，他敏感的心变得恐惧，以至有些畸形。他极度渴望纯蓝的天，纯白的云，纯洁的人生和爱情，可现实的污染和残酷愈发导致他内心的苍凉和悲哀，他笔下的世界往往开始是纯美的，是用“统银”的声音和色彩去构制的一个“天国”，而最终却都归于悲哀心情下灰色视线中的一片灰暗的世界。诗人的心灵被扭曲，流露出的诗人的视线也被扭曲，因此视觉中的一切改变了原有的形态。在他的世界里，寻常的逻辑沉默了，被理智法则所规定的世界开始解体，色彩音响，形象界线消失了，时间和空间被超越，世界开始重新组合，于是产生变形，这种变形，不是哈哈镜似的一人和世界在其中被简单、粗暴的歪曲。诗人的主观意识犹如各种凸形凹镜，产生了不同于传统的不同于古典主义的接近照相式的效果，它的效果是一种表现歪曲了的内在真实，从而带着极强的刺激性和无尽的魅力。\n    第三种意象表现手法是感觉的沟通，即我们常说的通感。\n    通感手法在中国古典诗歌中就早有运用，我们的祖先早就熟知“听声类型”，比如一个愁字可以有长度，“一水牵愁万里长”，声音可以有气味，“风来花底鸟声香”，而庞德认为现代派诗歌的通感就是取于中国古典诗歌，这个不无道理，而现代诗学中的通感范围大大超过古典诗，而诗的含量也骤然增大，在优秀的诗作中，颜色可以有温度，声音可以有形象，冷暖可以有重量，气味可以有锋芒。由于五官的相互沟通，彼此相生，诗的联想空间得到今非昔比的开拓。听观噢味触等感觉的相互“转移”所产生的综合性效果支撑和强化了诗的主体性，可以预计，一种具备质感重感“雕塑型”的立体诗可望与平面式的“小小感情画面”相抗衡了。\n    顾城诗中有大量的关于通感的运用，诸如顾诚在《爱我吧，海》里有这样一个意象：声音布满/冰川的擦痕，这里声音本无形，而诗人笔下的声音却是一个有形的躯体，身上布满被冰川擦伤的伤痕，无声的听觉形象被表现为有形的视觉形象，即视觉与听觉彼此打通。\n    再如诗人意象世界中的建筑是新鲜的，也是愚钝的，诗人笔下的梦是深红色的，夜晚是淡绿色的，等等。\n    通感的运用使客观世界一下子变得丰富起来，并且物物沟通，各种感觉互相沟通，在诗中创造了广阔的世界\n    第四种诗歌意象表现手法是物象叠台：即不同的物象在注入作者主体情感之后交叉叠合在一起，进而成为另一种物象的表现手法。这种手法往往是诗人内心情感的渗入物象所致。此如顾城在其诗《眨眼》中这样写道：彩虹，在喷泉中游动，温柔地顾盼行人/我一眨眼一/就变成了一团蛇影。这里彩虹和蛇影是美丑截然分明的两种物象，而诗人眨眼之间彩虹变成蛇影，蛇影又和彩虹叠合，两者互动互换，使无形中映射出另一个物象，即诗人的无形的心灵世界。在他的心中崇尚美，渴求美，但往往美的东西会在瞬间被摧毁，变得丑陋不堪。这样一种物象叠合实为诗人不同情感的叠合，情感依靠物象来流露，而物象又真实地反映内心情感，二者互为依存，构制了眼中象和心中意巧妙的结合的领域。\n    第五种意象表现手法是物人转换：即把诗人的主体情感完全倾注于客观物象，通过把物象拟人化表达到以物言人的目的。它有点类似于传统诗歌中的拟人，但又比传统诗歌赋于物象更多的主体情感，使其具有更多的深意和更广的人性。诸如在《我是一个任性的孩子》中有这样几句：最后，在纸角上/我还想画下自己/画下一个树熊/他坐在维多利亚深色的丛林里/坐在安安静静的树枝上/发愣/他没有家/没有一颗留在远处的心/他只有很多很多/浆果一样的梦/和很大很大的眼晴/诗人通过树熊淋漓尽致地刻划了自己真实的心态和内心深处深挚的渴望。树熊没有家，坐在树枝上发愣，不知该去向哪里，有的只是许多甜美的梦想和一双渴望幸福之光的眼晴，作者把树熊拟人化，树熊实为诗人的影子，通过物人转换，间接地表达了诗人的情感，这比直叙其事直抒其情来得富有韵致，诗歌的暗示性再一次得到体现。\n    第六种表现手法是因意取象法，就是利用想象，即知觉与表象的功能，然后以错觉或幻觉去感受这些知觉之中的表象，完全抛开作为客观实在的客观物象。诸如在顾城诗歌《我不知道怎样爱你》中这样写道：我还在叫/制造着回声/在软土中鳞闪耀/风在粗土中叹气/扁蜗牛在舔泪迹诗中并没有出现能够使人产生如上的听觉和视觉的客观物象。诗中诗人是在“以情合景”“因意取象”“创造性想象”中使审美物象完成错觉化与幻觉化的。这种意象构成方法的运用，扩大了诗歌的取象范围，诗人因减少客体的限制而获得了更大的主动性和创造性，他可以把自已复杂，微妙，难以直接诉诸实用性规范语言的审美情感，通过这种新奇，生动的感性画面诉诸直觉，投向心灵，收到更积极主动的意象效果。\n    第七种意象表现手法是省略跳跃法。即诗的前前后后似是毫无联系，完全是没有关联的意象，只是那么并列着，不同意象之间完全是跳跃式的，省略了其中的过渡或某些有关联的词句。诸如《孤线》：鸟儿在疾风中/迅速转向少年去捡拾/一枚分币葡萄藤因幻想/而延伸的触丝海浪因退缩/而耸起的背脊这里四组没有什么联系的意象，就这么并列着，并列的基础就在这四组意象所共有的“弧线”，这种并列形式的处理方式有点类似于电影中的蒙太奇手法。意象同样在于要把一个个浸透诗人思想感情的局部画面组合成动人心弦的完整形象。所以《弧线》中的叠加意象可以称之为诗歌的蒙太奇，是一门关于诗歌画面组合的文法。只是它不是靠摄影机去拍摄，而是靠语言来表达。而这种语言又不是平白详尽式语言，而是省略的，跳跃性的伴谬语言，这样从语言转化来的画面不可能直接呈现在人们眼前，而是在人们的悬想中浮现出来。\n    总之，意象本身就是语言，是超越了公式化了的语言。顾城诗作中的意象，形成了诗人独特的艺术风格。", "criteria": [{"name": "biographical_comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the speech covers key aspects of Gu Cheng's

How does that sound?\n\nLet’s start with Norway’s Atlantic Road! This isn’t just any coastal road; it’s like a roller coaster that nature itself designed for you. Especially that iconic Storseisundet Bridge—don’t even think about just driving over it, just looking at its shape that seems to rush into the sea will make your heart race. Step on the gas, and you’ll feel like you’re flying, with the howling sea wind on one side and the roaring waves on the other, almost as if the sea spray could splash onto your car window at any moment. What’s even more amazing is that seals and whales could also appear beside you—truly driving “side by side” with ocean creatures.\n\nBut don’t think that only Northern Europe offers cold and bleak landscapes.\n\nTake a turn, and we’re in the warm and vibrant South Africa’s Garden Route! This isn’t a winding flower-filled road, but rather a paradise of mountains, lakes, forests, and wildlife. One moment you’re surrounded by rolling mountains, and the next, a vast blue coastline appears. Wild animals occasionally pop out to say hello—elephants, lions... all of them. The best part is that in Hermanus, you can watch whales dance up close! This place is known as “the world’s best land-based whale watching destination.” Standing on the shore, you’ll witness massive whales tumbling in the water—a scene that will leave you breathless with awe.\n\nOf course, we can’t forget the mysterious Causeway Coastal Route in Northern Ireland. This feels like stepping into a mythical world, especially with the famous Giant’s Causeway—volcanic rock columns arranged in neat formations, as if giants built a staircase for themselves. You might even feel the legendary giants sneaking a peek at you from some corner. The Gobbins Cliff Path is even more thrilling and beautiful; this trail hugs the cliffs, making you feel like you’re walking on clouds. You’ll find yourself surrounded by seabirds and dolphins, completely immersed in nature’s embrace. Just thinking about it is enough to make your heart race!\n\nAfter traveling along these three roads, you’ll notice that each one has its unique style and charm.\n\nFor example, Norway’s Atlantic Road feels like a battle of wits with nature; South Africa’s Garden Route is full of vibrant life; Northern Ireland’s Giant’s Causeway is the perfect blend of mystery and fantasy. Each road seems to tell you that the world is vast, and wonders are everywhere, and you’re just a passing observer.\n\nFinally, we can’t help but ask—what kind of scenery can truly be called beautiful? Is it Norway’s wild sea winds? South Africa’s leaping whales? Or perhaps Northern Ireland’s ancient legends? Every road gives you a different answer. Data shows that in recent years, road trips have been gaining popularity, and these uniquely scenic roads have attracted countless travelers. In the future, who knows, you may have the chance to set foot on these magical roads and experience your own moment of awe.", "criteria": [{"name": "Plot_Structure_Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the five encounters are woven into a coherent narrative while maintaining the overarching theme and ensuring each chapter contributes meaningfully to character development.", "1-2": "Encounters appear random and disconnected, with no clear thematic progression or meaningful character development.", "3-4": "Basic connection between encounters exists, but thematic links are weak and character development is superficial.", "5-6": "Encounters flow reasonably well with some thematic consistency, though certain transitions or character developments feel forced.", "7-8": "Strong narrative integration with clear thematic progression, minor inconsistencies in character development or chapter transitions.", "9-10": "Masterful integration of encounters, perfect thematic flow, and organic character development throughout all chapters."}, {"name": "Regional_Atmosphere_Depiction", "criteria_description": "Assesses the depth and authenticity of regional descriptions, including landscape, culture, and local character, drawing from the provided road journey references.", "1-2": "Minimal or generic descriptions of locations with no distinct regional character or atmospheric elements.", "3-4": "Basic regional descriptions present but lacking depth, authenticity, or meaningful connection to the narrative.", "5-6": "Adequate regional atmosphere with some memorable details, though lacking consistent depth across all locations.", "7-8": "Rich, vivid regional descriptions with strong atmospheric elements, minor missed opportunities for deeper integration.", "9-10": "Exceptional regional portrayal with immersive details, perfect integration of atmosphere and narrative significance."}, {"name": "Character_Diversity_Development", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the depth and authenticity of the five strangers' characterizations, including their cultural backgrounds, values, and psychological complexity.", "1-2": "Shallow, stereotypical character portrayals with no meaningful cultural or psychological depth.", "3-4": "Basic character differentiation but lacking nuanced cultural representation or psychological complexity.", "5-6": "Satisfactory character diversity with some depth, though not consistently developed across all characters.", "7-8": "Well-developed, diverse characters with strong cultural authenticity, minor gaps in psychological complexity.", "9-10": "Outstanding character diversity with rich cultural authenticity and sophisticated psychological portrayal."}, {"name": "Young_Adult_Appropriateness", "criteria_description": "Assesses the balance of emotional depth, humor, and narrative sophistication appropriate for young adult readers while maintaining engagement.", "1-2": "Inappropriate tone or content for YA audience, lacking both emotional depth and humor.", "3-4": "Inconsistent tone with awkward handling of emotions or forced humor, partially missing target audience.", "5-6": "Adequate YA-appropriate content with basic emotional depth and some humor, though not consistently engaging.", "7-8": "Strong YA appeal with good balance of emotions and humor, minor inconsistencies in engagement level.", "9-10": "Perfect YA targeting with ideal balance of emotional depth, humor, and sophisticated yet accessible content."}, {"name": "Narrative_Scale_Management", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the plot framework accommodates the 100,000-word target length while maintaining pace and narrative density.", "1-2": "Poorly scaled framework with significant pacing issues and inadequate content for target length.", "3-4": "Uneven framework with obvious gaps or padding, struggling to justify target length.", "5-6": "Workable framework for target length, though some chapters feel stretched or compressed.", "7-8": "Well-structured framework with good pacing, minor adjustments needed for optimal length distribution.", "9-10": "Perfectly scaled framework with ideal pacing and content density throughout all chapters."}]}

Do you know their format requirements? Let's discuss them today. The format requirements for couplets are highly standardized and rigorous. The main requirements include equal number of characters, consistent pauses, matching tones, corresponding parts of speech, related content, connection between upper and lower lines, and requirements for the horizontal scroll. These requirements are not only rules for creating couplets but also embody their aesthetic beauty.\n\nFirst, having an equal number of characters is one of the basic requirements. The upper and lower lines must have the same number of characters, commonly five, seven, or eight characters. Whether long or short, couplets must strictly follow this rule. Couplets with equal characters create a sense of orderliness and symmetry, which is a fundamental characteristic of this art form.\n\nSecond, consistent pauses are another important format requirement. The pauses in both lines must be consistent, meaning the breaks in the upper and lower lines should be the same or similar. This consistency maintains rhythm and musical beauty, allowing readers to experience a harmonious and elegant melody.\n\nThird, matching tones is a prosodic requirement. The last character of the upper line must be in a deflected tone (third or fourth tone), while the last character of the lower line must be in a level tone (first or second tone). This tonal matching enhances the phonetic beauty of the couplets, creating a pleasing musical effect when recited.\n\nFourth, corresponding parts of speech is a basic format requirement. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., must correspond in matching positions. This correspondence enhances the literary beauty of the couplets, allowing people to appreciate the charm of language and artistic beauty.\n\nFifth, related content is crucial for maintaining coherence and completeness. The content of the couplets must be interconnected or echo each other, without repetition or contradiction. The upper and lower lines should be related, forming a complete meaningful whole. Related content better expresses the author's intentions and emotions, creating resonance with readers.\n\nSixth, connection between upper and lower lines is another important requirement. The meanings must be interconnected without repetition or contradiction. This coherence enhances the overall aesthetic appeal, providing readers with a complete artistic experience.\n\nSeventh, the horizontal scroll is an essential component. It represents the theme or central idea, should be concise, related to the content of the couplets, and maintain consistent character count. The horizontal scroll serves as the finishing touch, making the couplets more complete and refined while enhancing their artistic appeal.\n\nThe format requirements for couplets are highly standardized and rigorous. These requirements not only maintain aesthetic beauty but also enhance cultural connotations and value. Following these requirements in creating couplets leads to more beautiful and refined works while better preserving and promoting traditional Chinese culture. In modern society, we should pay more attention to inheriting and developing this traditional cultural form, appreciating its unique artistic charm and cultural value through learning and appreciation, contributing to the inheritance and promotion of Chinese culture.", "criteria": [{"name": "Artistic Theme Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the couplets incorporate painting and musical elements while maintaining traditional festive elements", "1-2": "No clear artistic references or completely missing painting/musical elements", "3-4": "Minimal artistic references with weak integration of painting/musical themes", "5-6": "Basic incorporation of artistic elements but lacks depth or sophistication", "7-8": "Strong artistic themes with good balance of painting and musical elements", "9-10": "Exceptional integration of artistic themes with perfect balance of traditional and artistic elements"}, {"name": "Technical Compliance", "criteria_description": "Assesses adherence to formal requirements including character count, tonal patterns, and structural rules", "1-2": "Multiple violations of technical requirements", "3-4": "Several technical errors in character count or tonal patterns", "5-6": "Mostly compliant with occasional minor technical issues", "7-8": "Strong technical compliance with very few minor issues", "9-10": "Perfect adherence to all technical requirements"}, {"name": "Linguistic Elegance", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the sophistication of language use and artistic conception", "1-2": "Poor word choice with awkward or inappropriate expressions", "3-4": "Basic language use lacking refinement or elegance", "5-6": "Adequate language with some artistic elements", "7-8": "Refined language with good artistic conception", "9-10": "Exceptional linguistic elegance with superior artistic conception"}, {"name": "Thematic Coherence", "criteria_description": "Assesses the logical connection between upper and lower lines and horizontal scroll", "1-2": "Disconnected or contradictory elements between lines", "3-4": "Weak thematic connections with obvious gaps", "5-6": "Basic coherence but some thematic inconsistencies", "7-8": "Strong thematic connections with minor gaps", "9-10": "Perfect thematic coherence across all elements"}, {"name": "Cultural Resonance", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the couplets blend traditional festive elements with artistic themes", "1-2": "Fails to capture either traditional or artistic cultural elements", "3-4": "Weak representation of cultural elements with poor integration", "5-6": "Adequate cultural elements but lacks depth", "7-8": "Strong cultural integration with minor inconsistencies", "9-10": "Perfect balance of traditional and artistic cultural elements"}]}

Future Development Prospects of Education Consulting Industry\n    With the acceleration of China's urbanization process, social stability and urban security issues are gradually emerging. Education consulting technology is a key technology for infrastructure development. Therefore, with further development of social economy and information technology, the application of education consulting will become a new trend in the future.\n\n(1) Market Size Forecast for China's Education Consulting Industry\n    Education consulting technology is being increasingly applied in people's daily life and work. As China's social economy continues to develop, the demand for education consulting applications will also increase.\n\n(2) Education Consulting Enters Large-scale Promotion Phase\n    China's education consulting technology development began in the late 1990s, experiencing five stages: technology introduction - professional market introduction - technology improvement - application across various industries.\n    Currently, domestic education consulting has matured and is increasingly being promoted across various fields, expanding terminal equipment, unique services, value-added services, and other products and services. Over twenty product series cover finance, transportation, public services, social welfare, e-commerce, and security sectors, marking the arrival of comprehensive education consulting era.\n\n(3) Market Growth Points in China's Education Consulting Industry\n    According to incomplete statistics, over 50% of companies in the education consulting industry provide system integration services, while 25% of companies on the New Third Board also provide system integration services. There is still significant space for system integrators in the overall education consulting market, with potential for increased market flattening.\n    Channels, customer resources, reputation, management, service, technology, and integration capabilities are core elements for system integrators. In the education consulting industry, which heavily relies on thousands of channels and has high product homogeneity, many manufacturers can combine these elements. By leveraging their advantageous resources, they can develop into system integrators. Expanding service types and scope can enrich existing customer resources and product systems while enhancing risk resistance and competitiveness. Of course, when providing integration services, attempt to make service systems lighter and easier to operate and manage.\n\n(4) Segmented Education Consulting Products Will Have the Greatest Advantage\n    With deepening applications across industries and departments, user categories are becoming increasingly personalized and diverse. The \"large and complete\" or \"small and complete\" unified model, including industry management systems with education consulting management modules, will eventually be broken. Professional segmentation will become the overall trend for education consulting-related project construction. More links in various industry information systems can be connected as relatively independent systems and segmented markets. Transportation information systems, government information systems, e-commerce systems, social entertainment systems continue to develop and improve. Software developers will be able to win markets through in-depth research and advantages in certain segmented areas.\n\n(5) Integration Development Opportunities between Education Consulting Industry and Internet\n    The internet's impact on education consulting will be more profound in the future. Enterprises use \"Internet+\" platform technology to improve network service levels and enhance competitiveness. Education consulting e-commerce will develop rapidly. The industry has established education consulting quality safety big data and internet regulatory technology platforms, enabling effective real-time monitoring of education consulting quality and important safety indicators.\n    Prosperous supply forms. Continue to support the integration and development of education consulting industry with internet and other industries, enriching new models and business forms in the education consulting industry.\n    This is currently attracting more social capital attention, with development opportunities brought by the integration of education consulting industry with other related industries. Current Internet+, real-time broadcast+, mobile+, e-commerce+, 5G+, etc., are examples of integration between the education consulting industry and related industries, marking important starting points for the education consulting industry to truly promote consumption transformation and upgrading. The integration and development of these major industries will generate countless new models and formats in the education consulting industry.\n    From this, we can see that China has begun to truly implement and promote the development of the education consulting industry. Previously, the education consulting profit model was singular, and the industry felt very confused, unable to find development direction. Although working hard, failure to receive deserved compensation made many lose confidence in persisting. Supporting the comprehensive development of education consulting industry and related industries, and formulating specific effective support policies will play a huge role in promoting the development of education consulting industry and enable it to find new profit points and establish new development profit models.\n\n(6) Broad Market for Education Consulting Talent Training with Promising International Cooperation\n    Strengthen talent support, advance education consulting professional education system construction, establish character, capability, and performance-oriented professional title evaluation and skill level assessment systems, expand career development space for education consulting professionals, enhance their professional honor and social recognition, promote guarantees, and gradually increase salaries for education consulting practitioners across regions. The continuous expansion of education consulting teams of professionals, technicians, and service personnel will be a major trend in future industry development.\n    Talent, especially professionals, is fundamental to education consulting industry development. Currently, talent has become a key factor constraining industry development. Solving the professional talent issue requires improving higher education consulting, establishing professional talent education systems, establishing education consulting majors meeting market demands, correctly positioning professional talents, and establishing vocational colleges for training professional service talent. Without a complete talent cultivation teaching and practice system, it's necessary to actively introduce mature foreign education consulting professional talent education systems, conduct in-depth research, combine with national conditions, and establish suitable international education consulting industry talent training courses and practice systems. Currently, China's education consulting technology alliance is negotiating with countries including the US, Japan, Australia, Canada, and Italy for professional education consulting talent training system cooperation, with preliminary plans to introduce foreign education consulting technology talent training as an important path to rapidly establish China's education consulting talent training system.\n\n(7) Education Consulting Industry Development Needs to Break Through Innovation Bottlenecks\n    The development trend of education consulting is that intelligence and ecology will become new standards and highlights. This trend can be seen from three levels. First is customer requirements. Practitioners have increasingly high requirements for education consulting and service quality. Second is government management objectives, initially only targeting enterprises. While doing good foundational work was enough before, now it's not sufficient. Besides high-quality infrastructure operators, clear directional guidance is needed in industry standards, prospects, trends, etc., with continuously increasing management requirements. Third is investor expectations. It's now difficult to increase product value with low-end technology, so many companies are changing direction to improve quality and value through industrial upgrading. Therefore, education consulting needs to continuously improve its innovation capabilities, break through industry bottlenecks, and achieve high-quality development.", "criteria": [{"name": "Content_Structure_Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the five requested sections and maintains logical flow while addressing each component comprehensively.", "1-2": "Missing multiple required sections, severe organizational issues, and major gaps in content coverage.", "3-4": "Addresses most sections but with inconsistent depth, unclear transitions, and significant structural weaknesses.", "5-6": "Covers all sections with adequate organization, but some areas lack proper development or connection.", "7-8": "Well-structured response with clear section divisions and good flow, minor organizational improvements needed.", "9-10": "Perfectly structured response with seamless transitions between all five sections, comprehensive coverage of each component."}, {"name": "Practical_Guidance_Quality", "criteria_description": "Assesses the actionability and practical value of the guidance provided for parents and educational consultants.", "1-2": "Predominantly theoretical with minimal practical steps or implementable advice.", "3-4": "Contains some practical guidance but lacks specific steps, tools, or actionable recommendations.", "5-6": "Provides adequate practical guidance with some specific steps, but could be more detailed or comprehensive.", "7-8": "Offers detailed, practical guidance with clear steps and tools, minor gaps in implementation details.", "9-10": "Exceptional practical guidance with comprehensive, step-by-step instructions, tools, and implementation strategies."}, {"name": "Integration_of_Expert_Input", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the response incorporates and applies the provided expert interview and industry report information.", "1-2": "Minimal or no integration of provided expert information, missing key insights.", "3-4": "Limited use of expert information, poor connection to practical guidance.", "5-6": "Adequate integration of some expert insights, but connections could be stronger.", "7-8": "Good integration of expert information with clear connections to practical guidance.", "9-10": "Masterful integration of all relevant expert insights, enhancing the practical value of the guidance."}, {"name": "Case_Example_Quality", "criteria_description": "Assesses the relevance, detail, and instructional value of included case references and examples.", "1-2": "No meaningful cases or examples provided, or examples are irrelevant.", "3-4": "Limited or superficial case examples with minimal instructional value.", "5-6": "Adequate case examples provided but lacking in detail or clear application.", "7-8": "Good selection of relevant cases with clear applications, minor improvements possible.", "9-10": "Excellent, detailed case examples that perfectly illustrate key points and provide clear learning value."}, {"name": "Technical_Accuracy_Comprehensiveness", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the accuracy of information and comprehensiveness of coverage within the specified word count.", "1-2": "Contains significant factual errors or falls well outside the specified length requirements.", "3-4": "Multiple minor inaccuracies or incomplete coverage of key topics within length requirements.", "5-6": "Generally accurate with adequate coverage, but some areas need more depth or precision.", "7-8": "High accuracy with comprehensive coverage, minor details could be enhanced.", "9-10": "Perfect technical accuracy with comprehensive coverage of all topics within specified length."}]}

{"index": 698, "domain1": "Education", "domain2": "Training Reflection", "query": "Write a reflection on AI technology training from the perspective of a frontline teacher or education practitioner. Based on actual work experience, discuss the application of AI technology in three aspects: instructional design, teaching management, and personalized learning, with emphasis on practical details. The article should be approximately 1,500 words. Additionally, extend the discussion to consider the significance or potential challenges of AI technology from three perspectives: educational equity, efficiency improvement, and innovative teaching models.\nReference cases of AI technology applications in education: Real Application Cases of AI Technology in Education:\n\nExample 1: Creating Personalized Video Learning Experiences\nSchools may find it difficult to achieve personalized education—but AI can drive its implementation and make the learning process more interesting, as students can learn in ways they prefer. Videos can help explain things better, just like pictures in books! That's why we can remember 95% of video information, compared to only 10% from text reading. When we combine customized learning with video, the results exceed expectations.\n\nAI adaptive learning platforms like Smart Sparrow or Docebo can create personalized educational experiences. They analyze data and configure unique learning plans for different user profiles. By making learning more adaptive and interactive, they enable students to persist in their studies.\n\nSynthesia and other text-to-video AI tools are very helpful in education. They can transform any writing into video courses within minutes. The courses are presented by AI avatars (digital replacements of real actors) and can use almost any language. Editing them to adjust information takes minimal time.\n\nIf you upload AI videos to simple course creation platforms like Easygenerator or Articulate 360, you can add interactive elements. The result is a super engaging course that students can easily learn from, presented by AI avatars.\n\nThen there are complex platforms with computational intelligence, like Wolfram Alpha. They cover numerous learning subjects, and students can receive AI learning assistance while using them.\n\nExample 2: Providing AI Tutors and Learning Assistants\nAI in education isn't meant to replace teachers. In fact, AI tutors and chatbots can assist teachers and provide one-on-one support for student learning. These virtual assistants make the learning experience more efficient and focused, making school more interesting.\n\nTutors will provide step-by-step problem-solving help. Schools can deploy an AI chatbot for subjects where students typically struggle, answering key questions 24/7 and reducing response times.\n\nTips:\nAI avatars can represent human personas and even clone real teachers to present video courses, with real human faces. For example, Tutor.ai or Syntea are platforms for personalized tutoring. Students can even get answers from internet browsers by inputting questions to bots like ChatGPT.\n\nApplication Example:\nThe German University of Applied Sciences provides digital learning for over 100,000 students. Their face-to-face, remote, and hybrid learning programs rely on 28,000 learning videos. All this is managed by a team of 200+ staff. When they developed an AI video production engine to scale video creation, they used it to:\n\nAdd faces to their virtual assistants\nTransform text-based case study assignments into engaging videos\nCreate 100+ courses for students and training for staff\n\nExample 3: Fast Track for Science, Programming, and Language Learning\nSome AI solutions in the market are perfect for explaining complex concepts. Science, programming, and language learning especially benefit from using AI. That's because these subjects are more intimidating and complex. But once broken down into manageable lessons, learning them becomes more approachable and enjoyable.\n\nFor example, Labster creates virtual science laboratories. It helps spark curiosity and allows students to conduct experiments and simulations, making learning more effective.\n\nSimilarly, Codecademy includes step-by-step programming courses. Khan Academy includes exercises and teaching videos for all levels.\n\nAI-driven language learning apps like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone are also very popular for improving communication and writing skills. They pose questions to assess learners' levels and create personalized plans.

“你的‘偷感也很重！”今年38岁的财会从业者彭女士听到“00后”年轻下属对自己脱口而出的话，一头雾水：“这是夸我还是骂我？”\n瞬息万变的互联网，总有层出不穷的新鲜词让人跟不上潮流：刚刚搞清楚什么是“人”“e人”，又来了“浓人”“淡人”；还没搞清楚其中差别，“偷感人”和“盗人”又来了。\n这些新的互联网流行“黑话”背后，是年轻人怎样的态度？\n    作为一名二孩妈妈，彭女士管理着十余人的工作团队，去年体检发现几项指标超标，今年她调整生活节奏，三个多月减肥6公斤。当她中午和同事聚餐时只吃很少的肉、大量吃蔬菜时，同事们发现她“变精神”的秘密，去年刚入职的年轻同事谢璇脱口而出“你的‘偷感’也很重吗？”啥是“偷感”？从字面意思理解，就是像小偷一样“偷偷摸摸、畏畏缩缩、瞻前顾后”，进而被年轻网友用来描述一种心理状态，即在工作和生活中谨慎小心，不希望被人关注，只想默默把事做好、达成目的。相比“偷”的贬义色彩，“偷感”更接近中性，既是事先不张扬默默成事，也是因在意他人目光和议论而试图“隐身”。在谢璇看来，比起那些把社交媒体头像改成“不瘦二十斤不换头像”的人，彭女士悄悄成功瘦身是“偷感很重”的表现；而自己因为担心能力不足做不好工作，希望周围的人不要注意到自己，同样是“偷感很重”，“这一次我因为说了“偷感’这个词而丧失了偷感”。”\n    在社交媒体上，不少年轻人描述自己生活中的“偷感”：有人在部门头脑风暴上怕被领导点名发言，先抢角落座位，将身体蜷缩；有人面对心仪对象渴望表白又担心周围人的目光，心理建设很久还是只敢在对方身边徘徊；还有人明明在同事面前不好意思开口说话，却偷偷记住了每个人点的奶茶类型.“一种不希望被人关注但自己会偷偷观察环境的状况。”不少年轻人表示，“偷感”给初入社会的自己带来了一定程度的安全感。自认为“偷感很重”的施蕾在一家商业企业工作，午后办公室点奶茶时她还在琢磨要不要叫新来的实习生，对方先主动凑过来问“姐姐，我可以参一份吗？“与“偷感”相对立的是“盗人”一一社交媒体上一张广为流传的影视剧图片精准描述了“盗人”的状态：女性角色在被问及为什么不接受一份工作时，她理直气壮地回答“我不会做”。“‘盗人想要的东西主动争取，不理解的事情就直接坦白，从不隐藏，从不内耗。”和这位新同事熟悉之后，施蕾曾和她一起逛过附近商场，“我一直很怕销售太热情，最好是自己假装不经意翻看价签，先衡量自己是否消费得起。”施蕾记得，这位年轻人从自己手上接过衣服后直接翻看价格，然后对着店员吐槽：“这衣服这么贵，凭什么？“打直球、去包装是“盗人”们的行事法则，这与过去职场上讲究“不暴露弱点”“高情商”背道而驰。“工作最重要的是完成任务。”工作3年的魏鸣初入职场时曾在一家户外活动公司被布置独立完成一个项目，他公开表示自己“做不到”，“我可以学，但学习需要时间。”在他看来，“盗人”有种不掩饰自身缺陷的“莽撞的诚实和粗砺的责任感”，与其勉为其难承担自己做不到的任务，磕磕绊绊勉强做出半成品再让其他人接手，不如坦诚自己的弱点，“先确保工作完成”。\n    如果说“偷感”“盗人”这些新词脱离了原本的贬义，那“班味”绝对是年轻上班族眼中需要杜绝和克服的情况。\n    “班味”即“上班的味道”，出自曾登上热搜的话题”一旦上过班，你的气质就变了”，直观形象就是职场人素面朝天、头发蓬乱、双眼涣散的疲惫形象。在社交媒体上，不少年轻人纷纷发出自己上下班的对比照片，前者衣着沉闷、不苟言笑，后者则光鲜亮丽，神采飞扬。“除了素色套装、公文包，‘班味更是疲于奔命的疲惫感和不得不遵守多种规范的拘束感。”在静安寺附近一家企业工作的郭先生一次加班晚归，楼上散步回家的阿姨按着电梯开门键等他，“小伙子又加班了啊。”“那一刻我意识到我有了一眼就被人识别的班味’。”他笑称，城市“班味”最重的地方可能是早晚高峰时期的地铁车厢，“最近京沪高铁、京沪快线‘班味’也很重。”对“班味”的反感，是因为年轻人懒情？在魏鸣看来“不是”。“我理解的‘班味”是对日复一日重复消耗的倦怠。如果一份工作不断有新挑战、学到新知识，就不会有‘班味。”在他看来，相比父母一代将工作作为生活的“绝对重心”，“年轻人成就感的来源更多，可以是工作项目上的一次突破，也可以是新学会的滑板技巧。我追求工作与生活的平衡。”\n    新的网络热词背后折射出年轻人对工作需求的变化。从“社恐”到“偷感”、从“拒绝内耗”到“盗人”，或是“职业倦怠”升级为更普遍的“班味”，越来越充满自嘲和挪输的新造词背后，也是年轻人渴望幽微的情绪能得到理解和尊重。彭女士从这些新词上获得启发，“年轻人需要的除了薪资报酬，还有尊重情绪价值、合理安排时间和提供更多学习机会。”\n    最近，彭女士又从年轻同事那里听到“硬控”一词，她以为这个词意味着“强行控制”，然而“意思是对的，但原因完全不同”。“硬控”原来指游戏中一项强制控制技能，发动技能可使对方无法进行攻击。然而这个词在网络上被用来形容一个人不由自主被那些独特、精彩、神奇的事物吸引而沉浸其中，无法自拔。“希望年轻人能在团队、同事带领下，也被自已的工作硬控。", "criteria": [{"name": "Target

The second strategy, which many people asked about, is customer channelization, mainly addressing three issues:\nFirst, inability to continuously acquire new customers\nSecond, inability to retain existing customers for repeat purchases\nThird, inability to utilize existing customers to bring in new ones\n\nThese three capabilities are essential for any business to succeed and grow. However, many brick-and-mortar store owners lack all three!\n\nMany owners maintain traditional passive business thinking, believing that with a good location, decent products, good service, and fair prices, customers will naturally come. When results disappoint, they blame consumers for being blind to quality!\n\nLet's look at a case study addressing these three issues:\n\nFirst, regarding new customer acquisition\nCreating a store's hit product has two approaches:\n1. Take the owner's specialty dish that customers order most frequently, offer it at an extremely low price to benefit consumers and encourage purchasing;\n2. Present the store's most uniquely crafted dish tableside for customers to watch, encouraging them to take photos and share;\n\nThis restaurant's signature dish is \"Flame Chicken,\" which incorporates a special technique of adding high-proof alcohol and lighting it at the table, satisfying both approaches!\n\nInitial promotion requires active efforts, such as collaborating with local food vloggers, creating your own social media accounts, or partnering with nearby businesses!\n\nCreate vouchers worth 20 yuan for a store with an average per-customer spending of 60 yuan, and collaborate with nearby beverage shops, hair salons, and clothing stores to distribute these vouchers as customer benefits for initial traffic generation!\n\nSecond, regarding reactivating existing customers\nWe know that acquiring a new customer costs more than retaining an existing one, but many store owners don't understand this principle!\n\nStep 1: Place table cards and counter advertisements promoting \"Scan to follow our service account for prize draws,\" connecting customers through WeChat!\nStep 2: Offer 20-yuan vouchers at checkout to secure future visits or encourage sharing with friends!\nStep 3: After some time, introduce membership top-up programs!\n\nVouchers and membership programs are traditional customer retention methods. Vouchers are simple but less effective, while membership programs are more effective but challenging. Adding customers on social media creates the best results for encouraging repeat purchases!\n\nThird, regarding customer referrals\nThe previous two steps already address referrals through photo sharing and voucher distribution, creating viral effects!\n\nSuccessful customer referrals require mutual benefits for existing customers, new customers, and the business. Traditional referrals are slow, but building relationships through social media enables effective promotion through simple sharing and engagement activities, especially given the restaurant's low entry barrier!\n\nThese operations significantly improved the restaurant's customer flow, particularly delivery orders which increased 5-fold, while overall sales nearly tripled!\n\nLater stages can focus on menu selection and pricing to increase per-customer spending; standardizing dishes and supply chain for franchising; or exploring deeper customer needs to provide higher-margin services!", "criteria": [{"name": "Program Structure Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the requested format and structure, including all required elements (subject line, salutation, program highlights, rules, CTA, closing) and maintains the specified word count.", "1-2": "Missing multiple key structural elements, significantly deviates from required format or word count.", "3-4": "Contains some required elements but lacks proper organization, with notable format or length issues.", "5-6": "Includes most required elements with acceptable organization, though some sections may be underdeveloped.", "7-8": "Well-structured with all required elements, minor formatting or length adjustments needed.", "9-10": "Perfectly structured with all elements expertly organized, ideal length and format."}, {"name": "Referral Program Clarity", "criteria_description": "Assesses how clearly and comprehensively the letter explains the referral program rules, rewards, and processes.", "1-2": "Program details are vague or missing, creating significant confusion about participation.", "3-4": "Basic program information present but lacks important details or contains ambiguities.", "5-6": "Adequate explanation of core program elements, though some aspects could be clearer.", "7-8": "Clear and detailed program explanation with minor details that could be enhanced.", "9-10": "Exceptional clarity in explaining all program aspects, leaving no room for confusion."}, {"name": "Target Audience Engagement", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the content resonates with the specified audience (housewives, young parents) through tone, examples, and personalization.", "1-2": "Content fails to connect with target audience, inappropriate tone or examples.", "3-4": "Limited audience consideration, with occasional misalignment in tone or content.", "5-6": "Generally appropriate for audience, but could be more engaging or personally relevant.", "7-8": "Strong audience alignment with effective personalization, minor improvements possible.", "9-10": "Perfect audience engagement with highly relevant content and ideal tone."}, {"name": "Reference Integration", "criteria_description": "Assesses how effectively the letter incorporates and utilizes the provided reference cases and data.", "1-2": "No meaningful integration of provided reference materials or success stories.", "3-4": "Minimal use of references, with poor connection to program benefits.", "5-6": "Adequate incorporation of some reference points, but could be more strategic.", "7-8": "Good use of references with clear connections to program benefits.", "9-10": "Masterful integration of references enhancing program credibility and appeal."}, {"name": "Persuasive Impact", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the overall effectiveness in motivating participation through benefits presentation, emotional appeal, and call-to-action.", "1-2": "Fails to create compelling reasons for participation or clear next steps.", "3-4": "Weak presentation of benefits with ineffective call-to-action.", "5-6": "Adequate motivation but could be more compelling or action-oriented.", "7-8": "Strong persuasive elements with clear benefits and effective call-to-action.", "9-10": "Highly compelling with perfect balance of emotional and practical motivation."}]}

Here are the main application scenarios:\n\nEnvironmental Perception: Computer vision systems collect visual information about the surrounding environment through cameras, including roads, traffic signs, signals, other vehicles, and pedestrians, to help vehicles understand their environment.\n\nObstacle Detection and Classification: Autonomous vehicles use computer vision to detect and classify road obstacles such as other vehicles, pedestrians, animals, and roadblocks to make appropriate driving decisions.\n\nLane Detection: Computer vision is used to identify and track lane markings, helping vehicles stay in the correct lane, especially on curves or complex road conditions.\n\nTraffic Sign and Signal Recognition: Autonomous vehicles use computer vision to recognize traffic signs and signals to ensure compliance with traffic rules, such as stop signs, speed limit signs, and traffic lights.\n\nAdaptive Cruise Control: Computer vision monitors the speed and position of vehicles ahead to adjust the autonomous vehicle's speed and maintain safe distances.\n\nNight Vision and Low-Light Navigation: In poor lighting conditions, computer vision systems can be supplemented with infrared or thermal imaging technology to improve driving safety at night or in low-light conditions.\n\nParking Assistance: Computer vision technology assists in automatic parking by analyzing the surrounding environment to identify suitable parking spaces and guide safe parking.\n\nPedestrian Behavior Prediction: Identifies and predicts pedestrian behavior and intentions, such as determining if a pedestrian intends to cross the road, to enable timely responses.\n\nRoad Condition Monitoring: Detects and assesses road surface conditions such as snow, water, or ice to help vehicles adjust driving strategies.\n\nVehicle Communication: In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, computer vision can assist in processing and interpreting received data to improve decision accuracy.\n\nIndustry Cases and Trends:\n1) Tesla is the only company committed to a pure vision approach, which is more economical compared to LiDAR systems. Tesla has collected vast amounts of data in shadow mode, though P3 considers Autopilot still a Level 2+ system.\n\n2) GM China plans to launch autonomous vehicle road testing in Shanghai. In China, GM has invested in Momenta and offers hands-free driving systems led by Cadillac in the US, though overall strategy remains unclear.\n\n3) Ford introduced BlueCruise technology in Germany. After exiting robo-taxi business with Argo.AI, Ford focuses on developing different L2+ and L3 applications for private vehicles. Like with robo-taxi operations, Ford likely won't develop SDS independently, with future partners yet undetermined.\n\n4) Honda offers its \"SENSING\" ADAS system, mainly pursuing MaaS through investment in GM's Cruise.

它们会在市场上停留很长时间，长达12个月，在此之前市场需求非常高。”\n杰克·蒙德（Jack Maunder），商业销售、租赁和管理，NAI Harcourts，新南威尔士州大港麦夸里地区\n\n“在澳大利亚的首要市场中，回到办公室工作的速度似乎比许多国际同行要快得多。大多数市场报告显示恢复至疫情前水平的70-80%。尽管有这个统计数据，但仍然可以看到混合办公/在家工作（WFH）“有些日子”的模式仍在发挥作用。这一趋势在一些主要街道的办公室中留下了一种相当萧条的感觉，员工对在家工作模式的喜爱引发了更大的反对意见。悉尼和墨尔本作为澳大利亚最大的两个城市似乎最难应对这个问题，许多中央商务区的零售商报告人流量减少和零售销售额下降。复苏正在进行中，但前方仍然有一些颠簸。”\nJason Luckhardt, 国家经理，NAI Harcourts，昆士兰州布里斯班，澳大利亚\n\n最终结论：与其他市场类似，希望办公室工作的人数增加的偏见存在。办公室人员使得建筑周围地区更加活跃和有活力。此外，NAI Global的回答者都在房地产行业工作，因此他们本质上是希望办公室需求增加的。城市密度、生活水平、城市规模和通勤时间显然是影响亚太地区远程办公偏好的重要因素，就像它们在美国和欧洲一样。另一个共同点是房地产业主和业主已经意识到需要投资于办公楼，并要求租户和使用者通过改造内部空间，使办公空间更加舒适、具有合作性，并最终更具吸引力。这些都是NAI Global专业人员的普遍观点，不论城市、大陆和文化背景如何。", "criteria": [{"name": "Research_Structure_Compliance", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response adheres to the required structure including theoretical background, empirical research, and case studies, while maintaining the specified word count of 5000-7000 characters.", "1-2": "Severely lacks required sections, significantly deviates from word count, or missing major components.", "3-4": "Contains some required sections but inadequately developed, word count notably off target, structure unclear.", "5-6": "Includes all required sections with basic development, approximate word count, acceptable structure.", "7-8": "Well-structured with detailed sections, appropriate word count, clear organization with minor gaps.", "9-10": "Perfectly structured with comprehensive sections, precise word count, exemplary organization and flow."}, {"name": "Data_Integration_Quality", "criteria_description": "Assesses the integration and presentation of statistical data, research findings, and trend reports, particularly focusing on remote work statistics and regional comparisons.", "1-2": "Minimal or no data integration, lacks credible sources, no statistical support.", "3-4": "Limited data usage, poor integration of statistics, weak source credibility.", "5-6": "Adequate data integration with some relevant statistics, basic source credibility.", "7-8": "Strong data integration with multiple reliable sources, effective use of statistics.", "9-10": "Exceptional data integration with comprehensive statistics, impeccable source credibility and relevance."}, {"name": "Theoretical_Framework_Application", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the incorporation and application of management theories, including time management, Herzberg's theory, and psychological contract theory.", "1-2": "Theories missing or incorrectly applied, no clear theoretical framework.", "3-4": "Limited theoretical application, poor connection to remote work context.", "5-6": "Basic theoretical framework present, adequate connection to context.", "7-8": "Strong theoretical foundation, well-connected to remote work context.", "9-10": "Exceptional theoretical integration, innovative application to remote work context."}, {"name": "Case_Study_Analysis", "criteria_description": "Assesses the quality and depth of case study analysis from different countries/regions, including implementation measures and effectiveness.", "1-2": "Insufficient case studies, superficial analysis, lacking regional diversity.", "3-4": "Limited case analysis, minimal implementation details, poor comparative insight.", "5-6": "Adequate case coverage, basic implementation analysis, some regional diversity.", "7-8": "Comprehensive case analysis, detailed implementation insights, good regional coverage.", "9-10": "Outstanding case analysis, exceptional implementation details, excellent regional diversity."}, {"name": "Professional_Relevance", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the relevance and practicality of content for HR professionals and management, including actionable recommendations.", "1-2": "Content irrelevant to target audience, no practical recommendations.", "3-4": "Limited professional relevance, vague or impractical recommendations.", "5-6": "Adequate professional focus, basic actionable recommendations.", "7-8": "Strong professional relevance, clear and practical recommendations.", "9-10": "Exceptional professional value, innovative and highly actionable recommendations."}]}

近3年全国行政复议工作数据统计报告：\n2022年，全国行政复议案件立案总量达26.9万多件，约70%的案件实现“案结事了”——行政复议，让争议化解更加便民高效\n近年来，越来越多的行政争议通过行政复议得到化解。据统计，2022年全国行政复议案件立案总量达26.9万多件，约70%的案件实现“案结事了”；审结案件中作出纠错决定2.9万件，制发行政复议意见书2683份。在服务经济社会发展方面，严格依法办理与市场主体关系密切的行政复议案件1.9万件，依法纠正土地管理领域违法行政行为3217起，涉及土地33.1万亩。行政复议化解行政争议的主渠道作用逐步彰显，在维护群众合法权益、促进社会和谐稳定、加快法治政府建设方面发挥了重要作用。\n这是行政复议体制改革结出的硕果——2020年4月，中央全面依法治国委员会印发《行政复议体制改革方案》，行政复议体制改革工作在全国全面部署推进。2022年10月，《中华人民共和国行政复议法（修订草案）》提请十三届全国人大常委会审议，以立法方式巩固改革成果，更好推进复议为民，提高行政复议公信力。\n灵活高效化解行政争议\n日常生活中，人们免不了会跟行政执法打交道。如，维持交通安全秩序的交通执法，对路边乱摆乱放行为的城管执法，对餐饮店食品质量安全的工商执法。但是对不少人而言，“行政复议”还是一个陌生的词汇。在我国，行政复议是解决行政系统内“民告官”行政争议的一种制度。当公民与行政机关发生行政争议时，除了到法院起诉，与行政机关“对簿公堂”，通过行政复议推动行政机关自我纠错，也是一种常见的选择。\n“行政复议制度的初衷，是通过行政系统内自我监督更加灵活高效地化解行政争议。”中国政法大学法治政府研究院教授曹鎏指出，相较于行政诉讼，行政复议是免费的，成本更低；行政复议可以直接变更行政行为，更为高效；行政复议从合法性和合理性两方面对行政行为进行审查，与行政诉讼相比，对行政行为的审查范围更加广泛，审查强度更深。\n长期以来，在化解行政争议方面一直存在“大信访、中诉讼、小复议”的格局。“以往，由于人们对行政复议并不熟悉，加之传统的行政复议‘关门审理、内部监督’往往被认为是官官相护，导致很多本可以通过行政复议快速解决的案件，还是源源不断地流向法院。”中国人民大学法学院教授莫于川指出，这导致行政复议制度没有发挥出应有的作用，同时有限的司法资源更加紧张。\n行政复议体制改革势在必行。在前期改革试点的基础上，2020年4月，中央全面依法治国委员会印发《行政复议体制改革方案》，行政复议体制改革工作在全国全面部署推进。\n“区县以上人民政府统一行使复议职权、建立行政复议咨询委员会为重大疑难复杂案件提供咨询意见、健全完善运用行政复议倒逼依法行政推进法治政府建设的监督机制、加强行政复议规范化信息化建设……针对实践中存在的诸多问题，改革均有相应回应。”曹鎏表示。\n“通过改革，行政复议制度的活力被激发了，其效能正充分释放。”莫于川指出。据北京市朝阳区司法局行政复议一科科长张秀梅介绍，2022年，朝阳区政府新收行政复议案件2003件，是上年的2.8倍；共审结复议案件1726件，纠错率为10.66%，调解率为37.6%，综合化解率达48.26%。今年一季度，区政府共计新收行政复议案件860件，是往年同期案件量的5倍左右。\n加强行政复议“主渠道”作用\n行政复议体制改革启动以来，不少地方便开启了行政复议工作机制改革创新，探索出不少好的做法，努力让行政复议成为化解行政争议的主渠道。比如，广西、甘肃等地探索建立行政复议员制度，促进行政复议队伍职业化、专业化建设；浙江杭州提出了“行政复议监审员”的概念，主动接受社会监督，推动阳光办案。\n根据《行政复议体制改革方案》，2022年6月30日，北京市朝阳区政府行政复议受理中心挂牌成立，行政复议实现“一口对外”；同年7月1日，北京市行政复议职权集中至市、区两级政府统一行使。作为北京市首家专业化区政府行政复议受理中心，朝阳区复议受理中心一经成立，便迎来业务的猛增期。每天前来咨询复议的群众络绎不绝，较改革前大为增加。\n张秀梅对记者说，改革后，朝阳区实现了行政复议受理“一张网”全覆盖，依托一个受理中心、一个受理分中心和各街道办事处、乡政府司法所的43个行政复议宣传咨询点，实现行政争议案件渠道畅通、繁简分流，实现“简案快审、繁案精审”，行政复议化解行政争议主渠道作用大大加强。\n人民群众的认可最能反映改革的成效。有市民感叹，以前复议不知道该去哪里、该找谁；如今有了专门的复议场所，有了专业的复议接待人员，而且不收费，特别便民利民。\n以往，从事行政复议的工作人员很多都身兼数职。随着改革后行政复议案件数量日益增加，急需建立一支正规化、专业化、职业化的行政复议队伍。2022年，甘肃省在推动实现省、市（州）、县（市、区）各级只保留一个行政复议机关的同时，首创行政复议员由省政府统一管理制度，出台《甘肃省行政复议员管理办法（试行）》，对行政复议员的概念、行政复议员资格条件、任命方式、资格撤销、禁业范围、表彰奖励等作出规定。\n“各地的创新做法与生动实践，为推动行政复议改革提档升级、推动法律修改完善提供了样本参考。”曹鎏说。\n如今，群众一封信、一个电子邮件就可以提出行政复议申请，足不出户也能化解烦心事，越发便捷的复议渠道，给了群众实实在在的获得感。\n更好推动行政争议实质性解决\n2022年10月，行政复议法修订草案首次提请全国人大常委会审议。作为全面总结改革实践经验的重要举措，此次修法备受瞩目。\n“此次修法涉及多方面，比如取消地方人民政府工作部门的行政复议职责、行政复议受案范围进一步扩大、进一步完善行政复议受理、审理程序及决定形式等，这是对近年来我国行政复议体制改革实践成果的一次提炼与总结。”谈到行政复议法大修，莫于川表示，近年来学界与实务界对行政复议制度给予了较大关注，与此相关的学术研讨一直在进行，相关的学术论文与著作更是呈“井喷式”增长。\n此次修法扩大了行政复议受案范围，比如明确对行政协议、政府信息公开等行为不服的可以申请行政复议；扩大行政复议前置范围，明确对依法当场作出的行政处罚决定、行政不作为不服的，应当先申请行政复议。\n“要进一步发挥行政复议化解行政争议主渠道作用，就要让行政复议这一制度尽可能地吸纳行政争议，确保行政争议进入行政复议程序的‘量’；同时不断提升行政复议解决行政争议的‘质’，尽可能将吸纳的行政争议通过行政复议程序有效化解。”曹鎏说，行政复议具有统筹调度资源配置的天然优势，能够通过穿透式监督实现对依法行政的倒逼与提升，扩大行政复议受案范围和增加复议前置内容，有利于实质性化解行政争议。\n完善制度机制、提升行政争议实质性化解质效，是这次修法的重要特征。“根据我国行政诉讼法规定，经复议的案件，复议机关决定维持原行政行为的，作出原行政行为的行政机关和复议机关是共同被告；复议机关改变原行政行为的，复议机关是被告。”曹鎏表示，共同被告制度在倒逼复议机关提高纠错率方面发挥了作用。但同时，这一设计也可能引发新风险，即复议机关因不愿承担当被告的风险而陷入“驳回会”的困境，甚至引发程序空转。她认为，此次修法有必要综合评估考虑双被告制度，为进一步提升行政复议实质性化解行政争议质效优化制度支撑。\n2023年全国共依法办结行政复议案件29.3万件\n司法部2023年法治政府建设年度报告近日对外发布。报告显示，2023年，全国各级行政复议机构新收行政复议案件31.5万件，同比增长17.1%；依法办结行政复议案件29.3万件，同比增长14.45%，其中司法部办结国务院行政复议案件4644件。\n\n司法部推动持续提升行政复议质效，指导各级行政复议机构依法办理涉及民生领域行政复议案件6.38万件，涉企行政复议案件3万余件。2023年，全国各级行政复议机构通过调解、和解方式结案3.7万件，一大批行政争议得到实质性化解。\n\n为加大依法行政监督力度，各级行政复议机构全年作出撤销、变更、确认违法和责令履行决定等纠错决定2.73万件，纠错率达12.83%。全国共制发行政复议意见书、建议书3800余份，实现“办理一案、规范一片”，从源头上有效促进依法行政。\n\n在行政立法方面，司法部制定加强重点领域、新兴领域立法工作意见及规划，拟订并执行国务院2023年度立法工作计划，审查完成立法项目51件。坚持立改废释并举，对604部行政法规开展全面集中清理，组织开展涉及黄河流域保护、青藏高原生态保护、行政复议等相关法规规章行政规范性文件专项清理，有力维护国家法治统一。\n\n司法部坚持“有件必备、有备必审、有错必纠”，依法审查各地方、各部门报送备案的法规规章3021件，按照法定程序和权限纠正和处理存在违反上位法问题的法规规章。指导各地加强行政规范性文件合法性审核工作，加大力度治理“红头文件”乱象，从源头上有效防止不当文件制定出台。\n2024年前9个月全国新收行政复议案件48.8万件\n　　新的一年迎面而来，亦正值新修订的行政复议法实施一周年之际。\n\n　　栉风沐雨，春华秋实。回顾2024年，全国各级行政复议机构全面贯彻党的二十届三中全会精神，以新修订行政复议法贯彻实施为契机，围绕行政复议全面提质增效采取了一系列举措，着力提升监督和治理效能，行政复议主渠道建设取得积极成效。\n\n　　收案数无疑是最直观可察的佐证。《法治日报》记者近日从司法部获悉，2024年1月至9月，全国新收行政复议案件48.8万件，达到同期行政诉讼一审案件数量的2.2倍。且经行政复议后，有35.1万件案件未再进入行政诉讼程序，行政复议案结事了率达90.1%。\n\n　　利国为民\n\n　　12月31日，2024年的最后一天，司法部发布了第五批贯彻实施新修订行政复议法典型案例。至此，司法部2024年发布的贯彻实施新修订行政复议法典型案例的数量已经达到27个。一年之中，多达五批典型案例发布，这样的高密度与快节奏足以体现司法部对此法贯彻实施的高度重视。\n\n　　行政复议是行政系统内部的层级监督制度和解决行政争议的救济制度，是党和国家监督体系的重要组成部分。\n\n　　于国家治理的大处看，新修订行政复议法的贯彻实施意义重大。“行政复议法的修订和实施是法治领域改革的重大成果。”中国法学会党组成员、学术委员会主任张文显说，行政复议法不只是行政领域的一项制度设计，而且是国家治理和社会治理体系中的重要制度设计。“我们要宣传好贯彻好实施好新修订的行政复议法，为推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化提供坚强法治保障。”\n\n　　于普通人琐碎生活的小处看，新修订行政复议法的贯彻实施不亚于抚慰人心的“冬日暖阳”。上海一位曾遭遇交通事故伤害的外卖骑手就从中获得权益的保障，成为新修订行政复议法实施的受益者之一。\n\n　　尽管交通事故已被交警部门认定为非本人主要责任，但上海市某区人力资源和社会保障局委托商业保险机构进行调查后，以发生交通事故时骑手处于下线状态为由，作出不予确认职业伤害结论书。骑手不服，理由在于，其行为符合《新就业形态就业人员职业伤害保障办法（试行）》关于在执行平台订单任务返回日常居所的合理路线途中受到非本人主要责任的交通事故，应当确认为职业伤害的规定，遂提起行政复议。\n\n　　行政复议机构通过听取意见、听证、现场勘查等查明事故发生时骑手处于执行任务后返回日常居所的案件事实。经行政复议机构指出问题，作为被申请人的人社局重新启动调查程序，并自行纠错，骑手自愿撤回行政复议申请。\n\n　　“就事论事”，从来不是行政复议的作风，这一个案件所带来的温暖已经扩及无数像这位骑手一样的新业态从业人员。为增强指导针对性，办理该起案件的行政复议机构还向人社部门和商业保险机构制发建议函，建议其严格规范职业伤害调查流程，把握新业态从业人员工作时间和工作地点非固定性的特点，全面调查核实事故情况，综合认定当事人工作状态，商业保险机构也对此进行了相应完善。\n\n　　实质解纷\n\n　　“复议为民”写进了新时代行政复议的基因里。在过去的一年，各级行政复议机关切实维护人民群众合法权益，积极畅通行政复议渠道，注重运用调解和解等方式解决人民群众的利益诉求。\n\n　　2024年1月至9月，以调解、和解等方式办结行政复议案件10.2万件，调撤结案率达26.2%。有1.8万件行政争议通过行政机关的自我纠错实现实质性化解。“大批行政争议实现源头化解、前端化解、就地化解，行政复议便民为民的制度优势更为凸显。”司法部行政复议与应诉局负责人说。\n\n　　在践行人民至上的同时，全国各级行政复议机构深入推进严格规范公正文明执法，倒逼各级行政执法机关提升依法行政水平，促进法治政府建设。2024年1月至9月，通过撤销、变更、确认违法等方式纠正违法和不当行政行为3.9万件，纠错率为13.1%。针对行政执法存在的共性问题制发行政复议意见书、建议书4271份，附带审查规范性文件420件，其中纠正不合法的规范性文件17件。\n\n　　“新修订的行政复议法在规范设置上着力形成个案纠错与整体纠偏的前后联动，在‘治已病’的同时，‘抓前端、治未病’，以点带面推动提升行政执法的规范化水平，实现办理一案、治理一行、惠及一片的良好示范效果，助力法治政府建设。”湖南大学法学院副教授展鹏贺说。\n\n　　市场主体同样从新修订的行政复议法的实施中获得高质量发展的动力。“真的非常感谢，行政复议让企业起死回生，也让我们深切感受到法治的力量。”云南省某药企负责人感慨地说。\n\n　　原来，当地药监部门曾查封了该药企的一批药材，并认定该批药材为假药，给予该药企没收假药和违法所得、罚款50万元的行政处罚决定。该药企不服，申请行政复议。经行政复议机构与申请人、被申请人反复沟通、充分释法说理，药监部门决定自行撤销行政处罚决定，并对涉案药企重新开展调查处理。该药企自愿撤回行政复议申请。随后，行政复议机构协调执法部门共同深入涉案药企，帮助指导企业加强自身建设，避免相关风险。\n\n　　记者从司法部了解到，2024年全国各级行政复议机构着力加强涉企行政复议工作，截至9月收到涉企行政复议案件5.1万件，以调解、和解等方式实质性化解1.05万件，纠正侵犯企业合法权益的违法、不当行政行为0.3万件，依法平等保护各类经营主体合法权益，助力优化法治化营商环境。\n\n　　提质增效\n\n　　一周年大考交卷之际，新修订行政复议法的贯彻实施这份答卷所呈现出来的是丰收之时的“硕果累累”，而“力透纸背”的是司法部这一年为此所作出的不懈努力。\n\n　　这一年，司法部联合有关部门开展行政复议护航企业高质量发展专项行动。为此发布的专项行动方案，围绕提高涉企行政复议工作水平提出5个方面18项具体举措，进一步畅通涉企行政复议渠道，做实涉企行政争议实质性化解工作。加强对涉企行政执法行为的监督纠错，依法平等保护各类经营主体合法权益，助力优化法治化营商环境。\n\n　　这一年，司法部加快完善行政复议配套制度。积极推进行政复议法实施条例修订工作，召开三次行政复议法实施条例修订研讨会。印发《行政复议普通程序听取意见办法》《行政复议普通程序听证办法》《关于进一步加强行政复议调解工作推动行政争议实质性化解的指导意见》等配套规范性文件。推动在中国法学会行政法学研究会组建行政复议专业委员会，借助“外脑”智慧为完善行政复议配套制度提供理论支撑。\n\n　　这一年，司法部组织行政执法人员云宣讲活动。以学习贯彻新修订的行政复议法为主题，聚焦解决当前行政执法中存在的突出问题，邀请实务工作者和专家学者剖析执法问题，解析执法案例，讲授经验做法，指导各地提高行政执法人员依法行政能力和水平。活动期间，培训平台总访问人次达510.2万，观看学习人次462.7万，有效增强执法人员依法履职和程序法治意识。\n\n　　这一年，司法部通过发布典型案例，指导各地将行政复议法规定的新程序、新机制落到实处，不断提升办案质效。\n\n　　新的一年已经开启。司法部行政复议与应诉局负责人表示，2025年，司法部将在行政复议提质增效、强基固本上下功夫，扎实推进行政复议主渠道建设和高质量发展，以行政复议现代化服务和支撑中国式现代化。加快配套制度建设，修订行政复议法实施条例，使行政复议制度供给更加规范、完备。完善“在线复议”各项功能，方便群众线上申请和参加复议。进一步发挥行政复议监督职能，规范涉企执法行为，优化法治化营商环境。加强行政复议“以案促治”，针对重点行政管理领域的突出问题发布行政复议典型案例，充分发挥行政复议意见书、建议书作用，推动严格规范公正文明执法。落实新修订行政复议法关于“国家建立专业化、职业化行政复议人员队伍”的规定，积极支持有条件的地方探索行政复议员制度。",

The classroom was exceptionally quiet, so quiet that one could hear breathing, making the sound of his sweat drops seem crisp and loud.\n\nThe teacher's eyes tried to comfort him, but he ignored it, just sitting quietly in his seat, his dim eyes staring blankly at the ceiling, saying nothing. At that moment, he seemed like someone lost in a dark maze, unable to find his way. His face, already flushed from intense exercise, combined with his sad and angry mood, became even redder. If you were closer, you might even see his blood flowing.\n\nAfter school, no classmates came to ask him about the basketball game results, as everyone already understood from his lost expression. Undoubtedly, he had lost; no one said anything to him because words at this moment would be like a drop of water in the ocean, creating no ripples, seeming fragile and powerless. Perhaps time would heal all inflamed wounds, and a moment of silence was the best medicine.\n\nThough it was only a one-point difference, he had missed the championship by a hair's breadth. Although there were uncalled fouls by the opponents, although he was the highest scorer of the entire game, it couldn't hide the fact that they had lost.\n\n\"If only the last shot had been more accurate, if that foul hadn't happened, if the game time could have been extended by one minute, even 30 seconds... but there are no 'ifs'.\" He blamed himself, felt frustrated, and regretted deeply, as if everything was his responsibility, trapped in the pain of defeat. That one-point loss seemed magnified countless times, like a needle piercing his heart, preventing him from escaping the quagmire of failure.\n\nHis \"comrades\" remained silent because they feared making things worse, like rubbing salt in his wounds, making him feel even worse. Moreover, everyone was immersed in the pain of losing. Everyone remained quiet, and the classroom's atmosphere remained heavy after school. The originally bright and spacious classroom seemed to grow darker and smaller, enveloped in an oppressive, solemn atmosphere.\n\nFinally, he left the classroom, looking up at the dark sky, which perhaps sympathized with the fall of a hero, expressing its sadness in this way.Please condense the prose content I provided into a short poem with contemporary language style, preserving the core emotional expression while incorporating more specific scenes or details, such as descriptions of certain events or key moments.

作家简介\n太宰治（だざい おさむ、1909年6月19日-1948年6月13日）是日本的小说家。本名是津岛修治（つしま しゅうじ）。左翼活动失败后，他多次自杀未遂，但在第二次世界大战前后陆续发表了一系列作品。\n\n主要作品有《奔跑的梅洛斯》、《津轻》、《人间失格》等。以没落贵族家庭的女性为主人公的《斜阳》成为当时的畅销书。战后，他的作品风格使他与坂口安吾、织田作之助、石川淳、檀一雄等人一起被称为新戏作派或无赖派。\n02・ 人物生平\n幼年时期缺少父母关爱\n太宰治出生于青森县北津轻郡金木村（现五所川原市金木町），父亲津岛源右卫门是该县最大的地主之一，母亲是津岛家的长女たね（夕子）。他是第六个儿子，也是他父母十一个孩子中的第十个。父亲是木造村富农松木家过继至津岛家的婿养子，由于纳税多，曾担任县会议员、众议院议员和贵族院议员，是当地的显赫人物。\n\n由于父亲忙于工作，母亲体弱多病，所以他一出生就由乳母带大。但乳母也只带了他不到一年就辞职了，之后是他的姑姑キエ让14岁的女佣近村たけ接替了乳母工作，从太宰三岁开始，照看到他上小学。\n\n1916年，他进入金木第一寻常小学校。津岛家的孩子无论实际成绩如何，学习成绩都被标为 “A” ，但太宰的实际成绩很好，据说他是该校开校以来最出色的学生。小学毕业后，他进入明治高等小学校学习了一年。据说是因为他的二哥英治和三哥圭治在弘前初中读了两年就因成绩不佳而退学，怕太宰也重蹈覆辙，以此来提高他的学习能力。\n学生时期渴望成为小说家但混乱拉开序幕\n1923年3月4日，父亲因肺癌去世。同年4月，太宰进入青森县立青森中学校读书，并离开老家开始寄宿生活。由于成绩优异，他到毕业为止都担任年级长，毕业成绩是148名学生中的第四名。\n\n太宰平时喜欢读芥川龙之介、志贺直哉、室生犀星、菊池宽等人的作品，井伏鳟二的《山椒鱼》更是让他读完之后兴奋不已。17岁的时候在学校的《校友会志》上发表了习作《最后的太阁》，还与朋友发行了12期同人志《蜃气楼》，此后志愿成为小说家。\n\n1927年，太宰以优秀的成绩进入旧制弘前高等学校文科甲类。暑假的7月24日，他在返乡途中听闻芥川龙之介自杀的消息，受到冲击，返回弘前的住处把自己关在了房间里一段时间。1928年5月，在同人志《细胞文艺》上以辻岛众二的名义，发表了受当时流行的无产阶级文学影响的《无间奈落》。但仅发表了一话就终止了，推测是受到了津岛家的反对。同时，一心扑在同人志制作上的太宰开始很少上课，成绩每况愈下，老师评价他 “缺乏诚实”，“外表看起来很诚实”。就是这个时候，他认识了艺者小山初代。\n\n1929年12月10日深夜，他试图吃安眠药自杀。他在《苦恼的年鉴》中解释他自杀未遂的原因是“我不是卑微的人，我是被送上断头台的人。”这里出现了他的自我身份与意识形态之间的差异。由于从1月16日开始，特别高等警察对弘高的左翼学生进行了陆续的逮捕，有人认为，事先从津岛家得到消息的太宰可能是为了逃避逮捕而企图自杀的。\n\n1930年，他从弘前高等学校毕业，在76名学生中名列第46位。不懂法语的他，因憧憬法国文学进入东京帝国大学文学部法文系。当时的英文系和日文系有入学考试，但法文系不受欢迎就没有考试。抱着试试看的想法，太宰报考了法文系，但恰巧法文系在1930年也进行了法语入学考试。\n计算失误的太宰在考场上和其他考生一起举手，向主考官辰野隆说明了情况，结果被特别录取了。不过，太宰对他的朋友大高胜次郎等人说的报考理由似是而非，如 “题目冷门”、“有著名研究家辰野隆在”等来虚张声势。由于跟不上讲课进度，他考虑转到美学系或美术史系，同时为了成为小说家拜井伏鳟二为师。\n\n10月，太宰让小山初代搬到东京并希望与她结婚。津岛家强烈反对他与艺者结婚，并由长兄文治来到东京劝说，但他坚持要与初代结婚。文治同意了这门婚事，条件是将他逐出津岛家，但还是答应直到他大学毕业，都会每月给他寄120日元，期待分得财产的太宰却失望了。\n\n11月28日，也就是他被逐出家门的十天后，他与银座酒吧HOLLYWOOD的女招待、18岁的田部シメ子在镰仓腰越的海边自杀未遂。然而，只有シメ子死了，太宰却活了下来。\n虽然太宰在《东京八景》和《人间失格》等作品中将此事件写成跳海自杀，但当时的报道称，他是在服用催眠药后被发现倒在海滩上的。\n\n他被指控协助自杀，但在文治等人的行动下，起诉被中止。在南津轻郡的柴田旅馆，他和初代举行了临时婚礼，但他们没有领结婚证。 年初，太宰与文治签订了协议，哥哥承诺每月寄给他120日元，作为交换条件，太宰要保证不给他添麻烦，并从大学毕业。就这样，2月，他们的新婚生活开始了。\n\n创作初期崭露头角但个人生活混乱\n1935年，他在《文艺》2月刊上发表了《逆行》。大学五年级时，太宰以为自己毕不了业会被停发津贴，于是他参加了都新闻社（现东京新闻）的入社考试，但没有通过。3月18日，他在镰仓上吊自杀未遂。住院期间注射了止痛药，从此对其产生了依赖。9月30日，因拖欠学费被大学开除。\n5月在《日本浪漫派》发表的小说《道化的花》引起了佐藤春夫的注意，佐藤春夫给他寄了一张明信片，称他给这部小说打了 “极好的分数”。第一届芥川奖颁发，《逆行》入围但未入选。作为芥川奖评选委员会成员，佐藤春夫的评论十分严厉，他认为《逆行》是太宰之前作品中的失败之作，而另一位评选委员会成员川端康成则对太宰的个人生活发表了评论，他说：\"作者目前的生活蒙上了一层阴影。”\n\n1936年，在第二届芥川奖评选之前，太宰给恩师佐藤写了一封求奖信。然而，佐藤从井伏鳟二和山岸外史那里听说了太宰对止痛药的依赖，便打电话给太宰，严令他住院治疗。\n第二届芥川奖的结果是 “无人获奖”，太宰也不在候选人之列。此时，太宰精神状态很不稳定，他向所有朋友和熟人暗示死亡，一位杂志记者被他频繁的言论和行为激怒，称他 “即使你死不了，也是一种威胁和敲诈”。\n\n为了准备第三届评选，太宰在《文学界》上发表了《虚构的春天》。6月21日，他的第一部短篇小说集《晚年》出版。他还致信川端康成，信中附有他的献辞和入选请求，川端康成曾因第一届的评选过程而称他为 “无赖”。\n\n由于规定，过去曾获提名的小说家不得参加第三届的评选，他甚至未获提名。\n\n之后他对止痛药的依赖变得非常严重，最多时一天要注射50瓶。 他典当了初代的和服，四处向熟人借钱。10月13日，在文治的要求下，他被强制送进东京武藏野医院。但次年，津岛家的亲戚，画学生小馆善四郎承认了与初代的不伦。3月下旬，太宰在水上温泉与初代一起试图自杀但失败，6月与初代分开。\n\n再婚后精神稳定创作不断\n1938年，太宰经井伏鳟二介绍，与地质学家石原初太郎的四女儿石原美知子相识。此时，太宰向不愿充当媒人的井伏鳟二提交了一份结婚保证书。他在文件中反省了自己过去的混乱生活，决心保护家人，并写道：\"当我再次重复婚姻破裂时，请把我当作一个彻头彻尾的疯子抛弃吧。” 次年1月8日，在井伏家中举行了婚礼仪式。他的精神状态逐渐稳定，发表了《女生徒》、《富岳百景》、《奔跑的梅洛斯》等多篇优秀短篇小说。\n\n川端康成对《女学生》大加赞赏，称 “一个评论家能遇到这样的作品，是偶然的幸运。”于是向他索稿的数量迅速增加。\n\n1941年，他被征召，但因身体检查发现患有肺部浸润而免征。这时遇到了太田静子，后者鼓励他写日记。太平洋战争期间，他继续积极从事创作活动，创作了《津轻》、《御伽草纸》以及长篇小说《新哈姆雷特》和《右大臣实朝》等。1945年3月10日，东京遭到空袭，太宰一家被疏散到美知子在甲府的老家。7月，石原家在甲府的空袭中被烧毁，又疏散到津轻的津岛家。之后终于迎来战争结束。\n战后女性关系混乱但以此为原型写下名作\n1945年10月至次年1月，他在《河北新报》上连载了《潘多拉之盒》。1946年11月14日，他回到东京，想构思一部像契诃夫的《樱桃园》那样描写没落贵族的小说，1947年2月在神奈川县与太田静子重逢，并借阅了她的日记。3月27日，结识美容师山崎富荣。他在《新潮》上连载了一部描写没落贵族家庭的长篇小说《斜阳》，12月15日，该书出版后成为畅销书，他也因此成为了一名受欢迎的作家， “斜阳族”成为了一个流行词。在《斜阳》完成前后，和小说中人物的原型，歌人太田静子的女儿太田治子出生。\n大约在10月，新潮社的野原一夫，在太宰情妇山崎富荣的房间里目睹了他大咯血，但富荣对他的治疗习以为常。1948年，他写下了《人间失格》、《樱桃》等作品。\n\n富荣工作出色，她辞去了理发师的工作，做太宰的情妇兼秘书，将自己的积蓄约20万日元花在了太宰的娱乐活动上。他威胁自己有在房间里藏氰化物，于是在6月7日之后，太宰被软禁在富荣的房间里。\n\n1948年6月13日，他与山崎富荣一起在玉川上水自杀。六天后，也就是6月19日，他们的尸体被发现。这一天恰好是太宰的39岁生日，太宰的同乡、生前与他有过交往的今官一将这一天命名为 “樱桃忌”，取自太宰生前不久写的短篇小说《樱桃》。\n\n03・ 作品介绍\n也许因为太宰四次自杀未遂而产生消极颓废的小说风格，但他也富有求真作家的面向，战时留下了《畜犬谈》、《御伽草纸》、《新释诸国话》等充满幽默的作品。\n\n三岛由纪夫曾举出刻画较深刻的作品来否定太宰文学，但当被逼问道： “难道你也能否定《御伽草纸》一书吗？”三岛完全无法反驳。与太宰有过交情的杉森久英，虽然一直不太喜欢太宰文学，但是在战后一段时间读了《御伽草纸》、《新释诸国话》后感叹道，自己只抓住太宰的其中一面而对自己的无知感到深深的耻辱。\n\n他还写了许多女性为第一人称的小说，其中包括《女生徒》、《千代女》、、《肌肤与心》、《羞耻》、《灯笼》、《等待》、《无人知晓》等。同样，代表作《斜阳》也是如此。\n\n太宰又和坂口安吾、织田作之助、石川淳等人同属无赖派或称作新戏作派。一般认为身为此派别其中一员的他喜爱颓废作风。然而太宰本身撰写这类消极颓废作品的同时，也同时是同世代作家中最常于作品中“祈求神明”之人，对此也有许多研究、评论。\n\n《女生徒》\n《女生徒》（じょせいと）是太宰治以读者有明淑所寄来的日记为底本而创造出来的短篇小说。\n以主人公的独白描述了一个14岁女学生从早上起床到晚上睡觉的一天生活，描写女学生一天当中对自我周遭环境的感触，以及对自我心境的批判。\n\n作品细腻地描绘了青春期少女起伏不定的自我意识和当时容易产生的悲观心理，得到了川端康成等人在当时文学评论中的肯定，成为太宰最著名的作品之一。\n\n川端康成评价道“这个女学生婷婷玉立，极富魅力，也有点高贵。作者在其中适度使用了所谓的意识流风格。它更多的是如音乐般的抒情效果，而不是心理效果。”\n\n另外短篇集里包含多则短篇作品，都是太宰治中期以女性独白形式抒发的作品。关于太宰治女性独白形式抒发的作品还有《维荣的妻》、《斜阳》。\n\n《奔跑的梅洛斯》\n奔跑的梅洛斯》（走れメロス）是太宰治于1940年5月在《新潮》所发表的短篇小说。\n\n太宰的文学创作可分为早、中、晚三个时期，这部作品与《富岳百景》等作品一起，都写于太宰生活相对稳定的中期。正如作品最后一句 “源于古代传说和席勒的一首诗 ”所揭示的，这并非太宰的原创作品。\n\n不过，作品加入了新的场景、人性的弱点、心理描写、幽默和娴熟的叙事技巧，打破了传统的关于信仰和友谊的权威叙事。这个故事在太宰治一贯以阴暗消沉、忧郁颓废为基调的作品里，罕见的呈现出热血和希望，带有励志的味道。\n\n《斜阳》\n《斜阳》（しゃよう）是太宰治于1947年所出版的中篇小说，是太宰文学中最伟大的浪漫主义作品。它的创作是出于一种决心，即真正的革命需要更美丽的毁灭。\n故事背景为二次大战后的日本，象征的是二次大战后混乱的社会下一个贵族家庭的没落过程，描写了战败贵族的母亲、妹妹和弟弟、颓废作家等人在战败后的生活。主角为女儿和子、儿子直治、母亲以及直治的老师上原。\n\n小说的主要部分由角色们的书信与邮记形式所写成。本书共分为八章，以和子的第一观点的女性独白体为主轴，第三章插入直治的大学时代手记＜夕阳日记＞，第四章插入和子写给上原的三封情书，第七章插入直治的遗书，第八章插入和子最后写给上原最后的一封信。\n\n《人间失格》\n《人间失格》（にんげんしっかく）是日本小说家太宰治的中篇小说，是与《奔跑的梅洛斯》、《斜阳》并列的太宰治代表作之一。\n1948年在杂志《展望》上作为全三回的连载小说发表，同年5月12日完稿。\n\n日文中“人間”意为人， “人間失格”即丧失做人的资格。该书在二战之后由新潮文库发行，至今已累计超过六百万本，超过夏目漱石《心》的累计发行数。\n\n《人间失格》一书以某作家为口吻写成。 “我”（即作家）在二战后于船桥认识酒吧的老板娘，后来老板娘把大庭叶藏（主角）寄来的三本笔记簿和三张照片交给故事中的“我”。\n\n三本笔记分别为“第一手札”、“第二手札”、“第三手札”（第三手札又分为两部分）。 “我”为其题上了“前言”与“后记”，并将三封手札原封不动地呈现。\n\n这三本笔记的作者大庭叶藏写了自己从青少年到中年，如何在权贵大家庭中生长、与父亲的关系、与同学互动、酗酒、沉溺女色、参加“非法”左翼团体、结婚、婚变、外遇、企图自杀等的诸多负向的生命经历。\n\n主人公称自己十分惧怕“人类”，只能在其面前冒着被揭穿的风险而终日演戏；曾因注射吗啡过量被送进医院，又曾被送进精神病院。\n\n《人间失格》是太宰治透过主角的人生遭遇，巧妙地将自己的一生与思想表达出来。《人间失格》亦可当作是太宰治本人的自传，主角大庭叶藏就是以太宰治本人为原型。",

Time Allocation: Specific duration for each section\n6. Teaching Evaluation Methods\n\nRecent survey data and research reports on high school students' psychological stress reference Recent Survey Data and Research Report on High School Students' Psychological Stress:\nMental Health Survey Report of High School Students\n\nI. Problem Statement\nAfter entering high school, freshmen often experience a period of difficulty adapting to the new environment in terms of studies, life, and interpersonal relationships. A psychologist termed this phenomenon as \"freshman maladjustment syndrome.\" If these issues are not resolved timely, they will significantly negatively impact students' healthy development, and in severe cases, may lead to behavioral disorders or personality defects. To understand the mental health status of first-year high school students and analyze the causes of psychological issues promptly, in order to take appropriate measures and improve the overall mental health level of all students, I conducted a mental health survey in Class 124 of No. 19 High School in XX City in November 20XX.\n\n1. Survey subjects: Students from Class 124, Grade One, No. 19 High School, XX City\n2. Survey method: Questionnaire. 58 questionnaires were distributed and 58 were returned.\n\nII. Results and Analysis\n1. Difficulty Adapting to New Learning Environment\nSurvey statistics show that 34.4% of students feel excessive pressure; 58.8% find it manageable. Regarding current academic tasks, 87.5% feel overwhelmed. When asked about adapting to high school life, 71.5% sometimes feel unadapted, while 18.4% always feel this way, indicating that students' academic pressure is overloaded. First-year students face heavier academic burdens compared to junior high school, with more courses, increased difficulty, and faster teaching pace. Additionally, high school teachers have higher expectations and requirements.\n\n2. Difficulty Adapting to New Living Environment\nIn the new school environment, 23.4% of students haven't familiarized themselves with all classmates, and 40.2% feel significant psychological distance between classmates. Regarding school environment, 45.1% are uncomfortable with new school rules, and some miss their previous school and classmates.\n\n3. Male Students Show Poorer Adaptation Than Female Students\nMale students show significantly higher maladjustment and psychological imbalance factors compared to female students. Females are better at expressing emotions and adapting to new environments.\n\n4. Unclear Goals and Confusion\n58.3% of students feel they lack goals, and 76.8% believe the class has a poor learning atmosphere. Many students have lost their study motivation after entering high school.\n\n5. Early Romance Psychology\nThe survey shows many students consider high school romance normal or even necessary, especially under academic pressure and adolescent troubles.\n\nIII. Requirements and Suggestions\n1. Change in Perspective\nEducators should change their views on moral education and correctly understand psychological issues.\n\n2. Guide Students in Self-Recognition\nHelp students accurately evaluate themselves and adapt to their environment.\n\n3. Study Method Guidance\nProvide guidance on learning methods and time management.\n\n4. Promote Cultural and Sports Activities\nDevelop new teacher-student relationships and encourage participation in extracurricular activities.\n\n5.

I'm grateful to my middle school homeroom teacher, who was both a mentor and friend, several times preventing me from dropping out, and continuing to encourage me even ten years after graduation. Without teachers' guidance, I wouldn't have pursued education until today; without their advice, I wouldn't have grown to who I am now. I want to thank Professor X and Researcher X, who accepted me despite my ignorance when I first enrolled; who taught me diligently despite my limited knowledge; who gave me the only available position in the lab knowing my weak foundation; and who worked tirelessly to secure me a joint training position knowing I didn't want to stay in the South. Though I only spent slightly over a year with you, your dedication, nurturing approach, and patient guidance earned my deepest respect. I want to thank Professor X and Researcher X, who cared deeply about my life when I first arrived in Beijing; who worked hard for my studies when I first came to the institute; who spent tens of thousands on my technical training; and who helped clear my path towards graduation. Though I was a joint training student, I never felt out of place. Despite your occasional reproaches, they were all out of concern for me. Your meticulousness, combined talent and virtue, impressed thousands of students. I want to thank Senior Engineer X. Without your connection, there would be no joint training; without your teaching, no chip technology; without your criticism, no progress. Your attention to detail and subtle influence earned my admiration. I want to thank all teachers at X institute, Teacher X, and teachers at X.\n\nNext, I thank all my classmates and friends. I was narrow-minded and arrogant in my youth. Without friends' help, I wouldn't have become self-aware and humble, finding like-minded companions and pure friendships - what more could I ask for? I thank my childhood friends, though separated by seasons, our friendship endures; though physically distant, we remain close at heart. I thank my sports buddies, sweating together on the court and sharing drinks off it; arguing passionately during games but chatting like old friends afterward. I thank my senior and junior schoolmates who treated me like family and helped me in every way possible, solving problems and offering advice.\n\nFinally, I'm grateful to my family. I thank my father who worked away from home for years while I studied, never sharing his burdens but causing him more worry. Your love is as deep as mountains and vast as oceans. Though I haven't inherited half your strength and determination, I learned about a man's responsibilities through your example. Any job is just for living, only family is eternal - I will always remember this. I thank my mother, whose love wasn't stern but gentle like water. Though perhaps not as famous as ancient educational methods, you still devoted your heart and soul to me. A child's gratitude is small compared to a mother's great love; a bird's filial piety cannot repay the debt of being raised. I thank my sister, only three years older but always protecting me. Though just three years my senior, you've always cared for me completely. I was naturally dull and playful, wanting to quit school several times. While parents were heartbroken but believed I would eventually understand, my sister believed I had potential despite lacking motivation. The whole family worked hard for me, and my college entrance exam results were barely satisfactory. Despite the high tuition for a third-tier college, my family unanimously supported me.

In modern terms, it refers to the power granted by the state constitution and laws to state administrative organs to execute legal norms and implement administrative management activities. It is a component of state power and guarantees social order. In terms of content, administrative power includes national defense, foreign affairs, public security, economic management, and social-cultural management powers. In terms of form, it includes administrative legislation, administrative orders, administrative processing, administrative justice, administrative supervision, administrative enforcement, administrative penalties, and administrative guidance.\n\nDefinition of Judicial Power: Judicial power refers to the authority legally enjoyed by specific state organs to make final judgments on disputes between parties. It derives from constitutional power. Judicial power became an independent form of power alongside legislative and administrative powers after the bourgeois revolution. Judicial power generally has characteristics of being judgmental, passive, neutral, independent, and ultimate.\n\nAdministrative and judicial powers are two distinctly different operational modes of power. Administrative power aims to better manage public affairs, with efficiency as its basic criterion. Judicial power, in contrast, aims to achieve social justice and fairness through case-by-case trials and protection of individual rights. The core values of judicial power lie in procedural due process, substantive individual rights, equal protection under the law, and the concept of equality.\n\nDue to our country's judicial organs often being constrained by local governments in terms of finance and personnel, reform is necessary to ensure true judicial independence. This includes reforming courts' financial sources and personnel appointments to free them from dependence on local administrative organs.\n\nPower balance refers to state organs with restraining authority controlling and limiting other state organs' power exercise through legal evaluation of management issues. The key to ensuring effective checks and balances between judicial and administrative power lies in:\n\n1. Limiting Administrative Power Expansion\n2. Ensuring Judicial Independence\n\nThe essential difference between administrative and judicial power lies in their nature: judicial power is fundamentally about judgment, while administrative power is about management. This leads to several distinctions:\n\n1. Administrative power is proactive while judicial power is passive\n2. Administrative power shows clear tendencies while judicial power maintains neutrality\n3. Administrative power focuses on substantive results while judicial power emphasizes procedural formality\n4. Administrative power is adaptable while judicial power maintains stability\n5.

海量聚集，对经济发展、人民生活产生了重大而深刻的影响。数据 安全已成为事关国家安全与经济社会发展的重大问题。党中央高度 重视，就加强数据安全工作和促进数字化发展作出一系列重要部署。 按照党中央决策部署，贯彻总体国家安全观的要求，全国人大常委 会积极推动数据安全立法工作。经过三次审议，2021 年 6 月 10 日， 《数据安全法》经十三届全国人大常委会第二十九次会议通过并正 式发布，将于 2021 年 9 月 1 日起施行。\n一、《数据安全法》出台的重大意义 《数据安全法》是我国第一部有关数据安全的专门法律，也是 国家安全领域的一部重要法律。《数据安全法》的出台，为国家重要 数据保护和各行业数据安全监管提供依据，标志着我国在数据安全 领域有法可依。 一是强化数据安全领域制度建设。《数据安全法》确立了数据分 类分级管理、数据安全审查、风险评估、监测预警和应急处置等基 本制度，为我国数据安全保护提供了法律保障，也为相关部门出台 重要数据目录、数据跨境管理等的细则办法和规范性文件留下法律 依据。同时，《数据安全法》明确了数据管理者和运营者应当遵守的 义务和责任，对相关主体形成制约机制，并为其开展数据安全保护\n—1—\n\n指明了合规方向。 二是统筹数字经济发展与数据安全保护。《数据安全法》坚持数\n据安全保障与数据开发利用和产业发展互相促进，在法律层面提出 了发展数字经济、弥合数字鸿沟、推进数据开发利用、培育数据交 易市场等要求，在保障数据安全的同时，促进数据的创新应用，激 发数据要素价值，提升数据对经济社会稳定发展的作用。\n三是指导行业部门开展数据保护工作。《数据安全法》明确了行 业部门的数据安全监管职责。在工业领域，工业数据既承载着工业 生产运行的重要信息，关乎产业安全和国家安全，又是驱动制造业 转型升级的重要生产要素，亟待有效挖掘应用价值。《数据安全法》 划出了数据活动的“红线”，为工业领域开展数据分类分级、跨境传 输评估、风险评估等工作提供指引，能够有效破解智能网联汽车、 工业互联网等应用场景的数据安全问题，从而保障行业安全和国家 利益。\n随着《数据安全法》的正式出台，我国网络法律法规体系实现 进一步完善，为后续立法、执法、司法相关实践提供了重要法律依 据，为数字经济的安全健康发展提供了有力支撑。未来，伴随《数 据安全法》的落地实施，数据确权、数据跨境等配套管理措施，以 及具有行业特点的细化管理方案，将成为下一步数据立法重点，我 国网络安全和数据安全的法律体系将愈加完善。\n—2—\n\n二、《数据安全法》的主要特点 作为我国数据安全领域的基础性法律，《数据安全法》主要有以 下三个特点： 一是坚持安全与发展并重。设专章对支持促进数据安全与发展 的措施作了规定，保护个人、组织与数据有关的权益，提升数据安 全治理和数据开发利用水平，促进以数据为关键生产要素的数字经 济发展； 二是加强具体制度与整体治理框架的衔接。从基础定义、数据 安全管理、数据分类分级、重要数据出境等方面，进一步加强与《网 络安全法》等法律的衔接，完善我国数据治理法律制度建设； 三是回应社会关切。加大数据处理违法行为处罚力度，建设重 要数据管理、行业自律管理、数据交易管理等制度，回应实践问题 及社会关切。 三、《数据安全法》的主要内容及亮点 《数据安全法》完善了国家数据安全工作体制机制，规定中央 国家安全领导机构负责国家数据安全工作的决策和议事协调等职 责，并提出建立国家数据安全工作协调机制。在网络数据安全工作 方面，专门明确国家网信部门依照本法和有关法律、行政法规的规 定，负责统筹协调网络数据安全和相关监管工作。 《数据安全法》重点确立了数据安全保护的各项基本制度，完 善了数据分类分级、重要数据保护、跨境数据流动和数据交易管理\n—3—\n\n等多项重要制度，形成了我国数据安全的顶层设计。 《数据安全法》对数据分类分级制度进行了探索。《数据安全法》\n第二十一条规定，根据数据在经济社会发展中的重要程度，以及一 旦遭到篡改、破坏、泄露或者非法获取、非法利用，对国家安全、 公共利益或者个人、组织合法权益造成的危害程度，对数据实行分 类分级保护，并明确加强对重要数据的保护，对关系国家安全、国 民经济命脉、重要民生、重大公共利益等内容的国家核心数据，实 行更加严格的管理制度。《数据安全法》针对重要数据在管理形式和 保护要求上提出了严格和明确的保护制度。在管理形式上，《数据安 全法》采用目录管理的方式，明确将“确定重要数据目录”纳入国 家层面管理事项，国家数据安全工作协调机制统筹协调有关部门制 定重要数据目录。而各地区、各部门制定本地区、本部门及相关行 业、领域的重要数据具体目录，有利于形成国家与各地方、各部门 管理权限之间的合理协调机制，推动重要数据统一认定标准的建立。 在保护要求上，《数据安全法》在一般保护之外，强化了重要数据、 核心数据的保护要求。一是规定数据处理者开展数据处理活动应当 依照法律法规的规定，建立健全全流程数据安全管理制度，组织开 展数据安全教育培训，采取相应的技术措施和其他必要措施，保障 数据安全；二是规定了重要数据处理者“明确数据安全负责人和管 理机构”的义务，要求重要数据处理者在内部作出明确的责任划分， 落实数据安全保护责任；三是规定了重要数据处理者进行风险评估\n—4—\n\n的要求，重要数据处理者应当按照规定对其数据处理活动定期开展 风险评估，并向有关主管部门报送风险评估报告。风险评估报告应 当包括处理的重要数据的种类、数量，开展数据处理活动的情况， 面临的数据安全风险及其应对措施等。\n《数据安全法》建立数据安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、监 测预警和应急处置机制，通过对数据安全风险信息的获取、分析、 研判、预警以及数据安全事件发生后的应急处置，实现数据安全事 前、事中和事后的全流程保障。《数据安全法》第二十二条规定：“国 家建立集中统一、高效权威的数据安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、 监测预警机制。国家数据安全工作协调机制统筹协调有关部门加强 数据安全风险信息的获取、分析、研判、预警工作。”第二十九条规 定：“开展数据处理活动应当加强风险监测，发现数据安全缺陷、漏 洞等风险时，应当立即采取补救措施……”从制度衔接上看，数据 安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、监测预警机制是国家安全制度的 组成部分。《国家安全法》第四章第三节建立了风险预防、评估和预 警的相关制度，规定国家制定完善应对各领域国家安全风险预案。 数据安全风险评估、报告、信息共享、监测预警机制是《国家安全 法》规定的风险预防、评估和预警相关制度在数据安全领域的具体 落实。从保护阶段上看，数据安全风险评估、报告和信息共享构成 了数据安全保护的事前保护义务，监测预警机制构成了数据安全保 护的事中保护义务，数据安全事件的应急处置机制形成了对数据安\n—5—\n\n全的事后保护。 《数据安全法》对数据的出境管理进行了补充和完善。一是针\n对重要数据完善了跨境数据流动制度，《数据安全法》在《网络安全 法》第三十七条的基础之上，规定“其他数据处理者在中华人民共 和国境内运营中收集和产生的重要数据的出境安全管理办法，由国 家网信部门会同国务院有关部门制定。”既与《网络安全法》相衔接， 也实现了对所有重要数据出境的安全保障。二是通过出口管制的形 式限制了管制物项数据的出口，《数据安全法》第二十五条规定“国 家对与维护国家安全和利益、履行国际义务相关的属于管制物项的 数据依法实施出口管制”，明确将数据出口管制纳入数据安全管理工 作中，实现了与《出口管制法》的衔接，有利于从维护国家安全的 角度限制相关数据的出境，对整体跨境数据流动制度进行补充。三 是对外国司法、执法机构调取我国数据的情况进行了规定。《数据安 全法》第三十六条首先明确“中华人民共和国主管机关根据有关法 律和中华人民共和国缔结或者参加的国际条约、协定，或者按照平 等互惠原则，处理外国司法或者执法机构关于提供数据的请求。”同 时规定“非经中华人民共和国主管机关批准”不得向境外执法或司 法机构提供境内数据，并对违法违规提供数据的行为，明确了包括 警告、罚款等在内的行政处罚措施。这一制度的设置体现了对于合 法合规向外国司法或者执法机构提供数据的重视，明确了我国处理 外国司法或者执法机构关于提供数据请求的一般原则，同时也是依\n—6—\n\n法应对少数国家肆意滥用长臂管辖，防范我国境内数据被外国司法 或执法机构不当获取。\n数据交易制度的确立使得数据依法有序流动成为现实。数据是 数字经济时代的重要生产要素，而数据交易则是满足数据供给和需 要的最主要方式，明确数据交易的法律地位，是满足现实需求、助 力数字经济发展的重要表现，是当前数据交易制度发展的制度基础。 《数据安全法》第十九条规定国家建立健全数据交易管理制度，规 范数据交易行为，培育数据交易市场。此外，《数据安全法》还在第 三十三条规定了数据交易中介服务机构的主要义务，规定从事数据 交易中介服务的机构在提供交易中介服务时，应当要求数据提供方 说明数据来源，审核交易双方的身份，并留存审核、交易记录。《数 据安全法》为数据交易制度提供了兼顾安全和发展的原则性规定， 有利于在保障安全基础上，促进数据有序流动，激励相关主体参与 到数据交易活动中来，充分释放数据红利。\n—7—\n\n中华人民共和国数据安全法\n（共七章五十五条，自 2021 年 9 月 1 日起施行）\n第一章 总 则\n第一条 为了规范数据处理活动，保障数据安全，促进数据开

治国、依法行政的关键和前提，没有依法执政，中国要实现建设法治国家、法治政府、法治社会的目标和任务是不可 能的。 各级党委依法执政提出的具体要求是多方面的，笔者认为最有价值的有以下十项： 从制度上、程序上规范党委与人大、政府、政协、司法机关以及人民团体的关系，确定“党委在同级各种组织中 发挥领导核心作用”，但不能取代，而应支持同级各种组织依法履行职能，特别是依法支持司法机关依法独立公正行 使司法权； 保障“各级党组织必须在宪法和法律范围内活动”，牢固树立“法律面前人人平等、制度面前没有特权、制度约束 没有例外”的观念； 尊重宪法确立的人民民主制度，党委对地方重大事务的决策和主张，凡属于人大及其常委会职权范围内的，应向 本级人大及其常委会提出建议，“由本级人大及其常委会作出决议或决定”，对涉及经济社会发展全局的重大事项，要 广泛征求民意，充分进行协商和协调； 推行党务公开，除依法应保密的事项外，党内事务除应当通过一定方式和途径向党员主动公开外，党员还可按规 定向党的基层组织申请公开； 建立健全党内情况通报和党内事务听证咨询制度，“党委常委会和全委会开会可邀请党代表列席，讨论涉及公众 利益、需要公民广泛知晓和参与的事项的党委常务会议，甚至可以公开举行，邀请党员、人大代表、政协委员或公民 列席旁听”； 加强党委新闻发布制度建设，高度重视互联网民意表达，对网上反映的涉及党委工作的热点问题，及时回应，“提 高在信息网络化条件下的执政能力和水平”； 建立党内规范性文件备案审查制度，接受备案的机关应当对报送备案的规范性文件进行审查，“对超越职权、同 法律法规或中央方针政策相抵触的，应当作出处理”； 加强党内监督，以领导干部特别是各级领导班子中的“一把手”为监督重点对象，监督内容包括人事权、审批权、 财政资金分配权等各种公权力的行使。 《法治湖南建设纲要》通过“地方性知识”对执政党依法执政的具体路径所进行的探索难能可贵。因为在中国这样 的社会主义国家实行执政党依法执政，没有现成的模式可循，必须依靠我们自己探索。）\n\n依法治国需要进行科学规划\n社会主义法治国家建设进程需要一份“路线图”。这份“路线图”就是对法治这一宏伟目标的最终到达作出战略 性规划,设定数个不同的实现阶段,以及每一阶段所要达到的阶段性目标,指明每一阶段的具体任务和衡量指标体系 法律作为一种根植于特定历史时期和社会经济文化环境的制度,反映了人们在相应时期和背景下的社会需求和价 值取向。中国的法治道路应当是从中国的现实需要出发的,不能也不应全面照搬西方。从历史上看,一些西方法治国家 曾将其法治体制移植到亚洲、非洲等殖民地,但从结果来看,并不能说完全获得成功。\n\n这在一定程度上说明了法治和文化、社会发展程度之间的紧密联系。笔者认为,西方的法治作为一种治理模式,是 其长期实践经验积累的结果,他们的法治理念更多地关注西方社会形态、历史文化传统,未必都适用于东方社会。 法治建设需要战略规划 我国自改革开放以来,经过三十多年的努力,法治建设所取得的成就是巨大的。 从立法方面来看,我们用三十年的时 间走过了西方国家数百年的道路,尤其是有中国特色的社会主义法律体系已经形成。 从司法方面来看,司法制度基本完善,司法已经成为最终解决纠纷的机制,职业化的法官队伍也已经初具规模。 从执法方面来看,依法行政、建立法治政府已经成为行政机关基本的工作规范和目标。 但是,我们确实也应当看到,我国正处于转型时期,这个转型不仅是从农业社会向工业社会,从计划经济向市场经济 的转型,而且,也是从人治社会向法治社会的转型。在转型社会中,必然存在两种体制的特征。 三十多年经济的高度发展,在经济实力大幅提升、人民生活得到很大改善的同时,也带来了大量社会矛盾和社会问 题。解决这些社会问题只有通过法治,也必须依靠法治。但这并不是说实现法治就能够一蹴而就,也不是说有了法治就 能一夜之间解决所有问题,在我们这种转型国家中实现法治必须依据法治本身的规律和我国的现实情况科学规划和稳 步推进,才能够最终实现我们的目的。 为了推进法治建设,我们需要一个战略规划；在运作层面上,法治主要是一种法律秩序和法律实现的过程及状态。 法治本身就是一个动态的过程,因此法治建设的推进也必须在党的领导下,有序稳步推进。 为此,社会主义法治国家建设 进程需要一份“路线图”。这份“路线图”就是对法治这一宏伟目标的最终到达作出战略性规划,设定数个不同的实现 阶段,以及每一阶段所要达到的阶段性目标,指明每一阶段的具体任务和衡量指标体系。 制定这一战略规划的必要性在于:一方面,通过战略规划可以实现向法治国转型中的社会稳定有序。法治不能大跃 进,不能脱离国家社会发展水平。在推进法治的过程中,必然会遇到各种困难和障碍,甚至可能遭遇社会动荡。如果有了 战略规划,我们就可以按照所设想的步骤逐步推进,并可以制定预案,即在总体法治战略规划制定之后,各级机关、各部 门也应当围绕本部门的各项任务,确定本部门具体落实计划以及相关应急预案。这样,通过富有前瞻性的战略规划以及 相关配套政策、措施,就可以有效避免或者缓解对社会可能带来的冲击。 另一方面,通过战略规划也有助于推进社会主义民主政治的不断完善。 在现代社会,民主和法治是始终不可分离的。 民主是依法治国必备的政治基础,没有民主,就不可能使法律体现充分体现民意,法律在实践中就难以甚至无法得到社 会大众的认同。 战略规划推进法治建设切实可行 通过分解法治实现过程中的步骤和措施,制定战略规划是完全可行的。法治目标的实现,不可能完全依照边实践、 边摸索的逻辑,而需要事先作出战略性规划。 这是因为,法治作为人类文明发展的普遍性成果,在数百年的法律发展史中 已经形成了一些具有共性的规律和路径；不同法律传统的法治仍然具有一些基本的共同原则。 从我国法治建设的实践来看,采取规划的方式推进改革是行之有效的。 从立法来看,我们历来都有立法规划,立法规 划确保了法律体系的科学性和完备性,从而稳步推进了社会主义法律体系的形成。 从行政执法来看,国务院在 2004 年颁 布了 《全面推进依法行政实施纲要》 ,这一纲要就其性质而言,就是依法行政的规划,各级行政机关正是按照纲要的要求, 推进依法行政和建设法治政府,从而稳步地推进了政府法治建设。从司法来看,最高人民法院在司法改革方面一直采取 规划的方式,曾经颁布了《人民法院第二个五年改革纲要》等,系统部署了 2004 年至 2008 年法院改革各项措施,启动人 民法院新一轮的全面改革,为司法改革的有序推进发挥了重要作用。但是,从全国范围来,我们缺乏全面推进法治的规 划。 法制建设战略规划的目标\n\n笔者认为,制定法治建设的战略规划,首先就要明确宪法确立的“依法治国,建设社会主义法治国家”的目标,在此 目标之下,可以将法治建设的内容分解为如下几个部分,并分别拟定规划,确立各阶段发展目标: 第一,宪政制度建设规划。 依法治国,首先必须是依宪治国。 法治的形式性要求是,政府所行使的一切权力都必须来 源于宪法的授权,并受宪法的制约。实现依宪治国,不仅要全面贯彻和实施宪法,还要建立和完善宪法监督机制,使一切 违反宪法的行为都得到及时纠正。在此项任务中,可以具体分解为:公权力的分配和监督,公民基本权利的保护,进一步 完善宪法的监督和实施制度、预决算公开和监督制度、选举制度的完善等。 第二,立法任务规划。在社会主义法律体系建立之后,我国还有很多具体立法工作有待完善,例如,加快民法典的制 定、完善有关社会保障法、对程序法进行必要的修改等等。再如,通过劳动和社会保障制度的完善,来实现公民的社会 性权利。 第三,司法改革规划。在司法方面,我们应当逐步建立公正、权威、高效的司法机构,保障司法机关依法独立行使审 判权。我们应当继续推进法官职业化,完善诉讼程序、审判监督、执行程序、法律援助、冤假错案的纠正与赔偿等一系 列制度；进一步完善法院经费保障、法官薪酬、培训等相关司法保障制度；进一步完善执行程序,化解“执行难”、 “执 行乱”的问题。 第四,依法行政与建立法治政府。一方面,要应当进一步界定政府与市场、社会的关系,厘定政企关系、政事关系； 进一步压缩政府审批权限、明确行政权力界限、规范行政行为程序、加强行政信息公开,切实维护公民对行政机关的监 督权利。另一方面,要进一步加强对行政相对人的保护,完善行政诉讼、复议等制度,逐步扩大对行政行为的司法审查范 围和强度。 第五,完善对私权的保护机制。公民权利的保护是法治建设的重要目标,这其中不仅包括公民的宪法基本权利的保 护,也包括其他权利的保护。这就需要进一步完善立法、切实落实宪法关于基本权利的规定；努力降低犯罪率,规范多 元纠纷解决机制,化解各种社会矛盾,充分保障公民的财产人身安全和私权。 第六,法治的关键还在于引导公民树立社会主义法治理念、养成遵纪守法的良好习惯。为此,应当进一步加强普法 和法治教育的力度,积极探索法治宣传新手段的运用,进一步改革和完善法学教育以及司法考试制度,为国家法治建设 培养合格的法律人才。\n\n社会管理创新须遵循法治轨道\n加强和创新社会管理，是我们党正确面对当前经济社会发展的形势作出的重大决策部署。加强和创新社会管理， 必须遵循法治思想，在依法治国方略指引下，正确实施法律，严格依法办事，维护社会公平正义。 一、法治是社会管理创新的前提和保障 社会管理是国家为达到预期目的，促进社会的协调运转，通过行使国家权力，对社会系统的组成部分、社会生活 的不同领域以及社会共同事务进行组织、 协调、 服务和控制的过程。 法治对社会管理创新有着重要的促进和保障作用， 社会管理创新离不开法治。 （一）法治是最佳的社会管理模式。亚里士多德说：“法治应当优于一人之治”。长期以来，中国在治国理政及社 会管理方面，一直奉行“人治”，主张“贤人政治”，把治理国家、管理社会事务的希望寄托在当权者个人身上。从历史 上看，一些贤者也确实把国家社会事务管理得井井有条，出现了诸如“文景之治”、“贞观之治”等盛世，然而，人治终 究难以使社会长治久安， 甚至会产生一些不可挽回的灾难。 历史和实践证明， 法治是目前人类社会探索出的治理国家、 管理社会事务的最合理的模式，在没有其他更合理的模式出现之前，法治就是最优的社会管理模式。 （二）法治是社会管理的重要手段和有力保障。任何社会都不可能没有矛盾纠纷，而解决矛盾的方式在不同的社 会治理模式下会呈现出不同的状态。但不管何种状态，任何社会矛盾的解决不外乎两种方式：一是以科学有效的社会\n\n机制在体系内和平理性地化解；二是不能在体系内化解，只有引发社会革命解决。作为执政党，决不希望社会动荡。 胡锦涛总书记指出：“法治是以和平理性的方式解决矛盾纠纷的最佳途径。”在法治状态下，公权力受到制约，公民的 合法权利能够得到宪法和法律的有效保障和救济，人与人、人与社会之间的矛盾都在理性的法律程序下得到妥善化解 和终结，并能对矛盾纠纷解决方案及未来生活产生一个基本明确的预期，从而使社会矛盾得到自我消弭，社会管理秩 序得到正常运转，社会得以和谐稳定发展。这正是加强和创新社会管理的根本目的。 （三）落实依法治国方略是社会管理创新的必然要求。法律是党的成熟政策的法律化，是党的政治智慧、治理国 家经验的法律化，是党所代表的人民意志的法律化。因此，严格执行法律，就是严格执行党的路线、方针、政策，就 是执行党的意志，而绝不是在法律之外寻求权变之策。当前，社会转型时期，社会矛盾纠纷的产生和发展虽有多方面 的原因，但没有依法办事，执法不严、执法不公是众多矛盾纠纷产生、发展、升级的主要原因。解决这些矛盾纠纷， 协调社会关系，规范社会行为，应当深入贯彻落实科学发展观，全面落实依法治国基本方略，以法律手段为最主要的 解决手段和第一解决手段，综合运用政治、经济及其他手段。 二、推进社会管理创新必须正确实施法律 徒法不足以自行。加强和创新社会管理，推进社会主义法治建设，必须依赖于法律的正确实施。 （一）正确实施法律是社会主义法治的应有之意。社会主义法治的基本要求被具体概括和表述为“有法可依、有 法必依、执法必严、违法必究”十六字方针。这既是我国健全社会主义法制建设的指导方针，也是我国落实依法治国 方略、建设法治国家的基本要求。从法的实施角度看，有法可依属于立法范畴，有法必依、执法必严、违法必究属于 法的实施范畴。 （二）正确实施法律是维护社会秩序的需要。通过正当立法程序制定出来的法律体现了党的意志和人民的意志的 统一，是规范人民权利义务、分配社会资源和利益的规范性文件。实施法律，就是要把这些抽象的权利义务变成具体 的权利义务，从而发挥调整法的调整社会秩序功能。如果法律不能得到有效实施，公民的合法权利就会无法得到有效 保护，人民群众就会更加不相信法律，不相信执法部门，有了纠纷也可能不愿意提交司法部门解决，而会选择私力救 济渠道，如私了等，由此可能会产生更多的纠纷，简单的矛盾甚至会复杂化。 （三）正确实施法律在社会主义法律体系形成后显得更为重要。多年来，全国人大及其常委会、国务院及其他有 权机关制定了大量的法律法规、自治条例、单行条例等等广义上的“法”，立法无论数量还是法律种类及内容都有了较 大的改善。去年年初，中央政治局常委、全国人大常委会委员长吴邦国郑重宣布，有中国特色的社会主义法律体系已 经基本形成。法律体系形成后，我国法治建设的重点和方向就转向了确保法律的正确实施。在此背景下，加强和推进 社会管理创新，应当沿着法治轨道，积极促进法律的正确实施，依靠法律规范公民权利义务，分配利益关系，化解矛 盾纠纷。 三、人民法院在法律实施过程中担负着重要职责 司法的中立性、统一性、专业性、公开性以及司法机关依法独立行使职权等禀赋，决定了其在社会管理中具有独 特的价值。人民法院的功能涉及到方方面面，但其最主要、最基本的功能是权利救济、公权制约和终结纠纷功能。这 三大功能充分体现了司法在社会管理中的独特价值，也充分体现了人民法院在法律实施中的重要职责。 （一）人民法院是重要的法律实施主体。法律实施，是指法律在社会生活中被人们实际地贯彻执行，包括执法、 司法、守法和法律监督各个环节，其中司法是法律与其他社会系统相联系的纽带和中介，是实现法的既定目的的重要 形式，在法律实施中发挥着至关重要的作用。人民法院一方面通过执法办案进行着具体的法律条款适用，另一方面， 通过对公权力的制约， 对具体行政执法活动进行着法律上的监督和规范， 以国家赋予的司法职权保障着法律有效实施， 是重要的法律实施主体。 （二）法院职能作用发挥情况影响着法律实施效果。“法院是法律帝国的首都。”人民法院在具体的执法办案过程 中，一方面，通过严格依法裁判，依法办事，使法律赋予公民的抽象的权利义务转化为具体的权利义务，使当事人及 社会群众体会到法的作用、价值，另一方面，通过能动司法，弥补立法的缺陷和不足，弘扬社会主义法治精神，促进 形成学法用法守法的社会氛围。 如果法院职能作用发挥得不够充分， 法律对社会生活的具体作用就无法得到充分展示。\n\n（三）司法功能诠释着法律的功能和价值。一般来说，法律具有自由、正义、秩序等社会基本价值，并具有分配 社会利益、解决社会纠纷、实施社会管理等功能，而司法则具有权利救济、公权制约、终结纠纷等功能。司法通过救 济公民权利、制约公权力、裁判纠纷等使社会正义得以实现，正常的社会管理秩序得以维护。在法律实施中，司法功 能直接诠释着法律的功能和价值。 如前所述，法治是社会管理创新的前提和保障，推进社会管理创新有赖于法律的正确实施，而人民法院又在法律 实施中担负着重要的职责。由此可以推论，加强和创新社会管理，应当遵循法治轨道，充分发挥人民法院的职能作用。 协调社会关系、化解社会矛盾、促进社会公正、应对社会风险、保持社会稳定等社会管理具体任务的实现，都与人民 法院息息相关，离不开法院的积极作为，且实践中法院通过调处纠纷、打击犯罪、支持行政机关履行社会管理职责、 延伸司法服务等方面的具体举措，为进一步加强和推进社会管理作出了积极贡献。理论分析及多年的司法实践均表明 人民法院在推进社会管理创新方面扮演着重要角色，人民法院是社会管理创新的重要参与者和推动者，在解决矛盾纠 纷、维护社会和谐稳定、促进社会发展方面有着独特和不可替代的优势和特点，在推进社会管理创新中发挥着其他组 织、机关不可替代的重要作用", "criteria": [{"name": "Content_Structure_Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the five

智慧城市的应用范畴是整个城市。智能家居是智慧城市建设的微观节 点，是智慧城市得以有机互动、良险运行的基石;而智慧城市进入百 姓家庭的最好路径就是透过智能家居。\n\n2、智能家居的发展历程和现状 智能家居从上世纪 8090 年代开始进入我国，从简单的系统内呼\n叫通讯和遥控开锁开始，产品范围逐渐扩展到 90 年代的非可视的楼 宇对讲、可视楼宇对讲等。进入 21 世纪，智能化社区概念初步形成， 智慧家庭的产品种类也逐渐丰富，并朝着集成化、网络化、数字化、 无线化、智能化、模块化不断发展。\n智能家居按销售渠道不同可分为工程渠道市场和零售渠道市场， 按安装时点不同可分为前装市场和后装市场。当前智能家居市场仍以 工程市场、前装为主，零售渠道、后装市场刚刚起步。2024 年苏宁推\n\n出私享家服务，为消费者提供智能家居整体解决方案，标志着智能家 居开始向零售、后装市场渗透。\n不同的市场对于智能家居产品的要求各不相同。工程渠道市场主 要包括房地产开发商、物业管理公司等，需求一般侧重安防、智能灯 光和社区管理领域;零售市场包括装修市场、影音店等，目前也正开 始进入家电零售店，零售渠道而向个人消费者，其需求一般更为多样 化，影音系统、安防对讲、智能灯光和背景音乐的需求一般较为常见。\n3、智能家居在高端楼盘应用案例 智能家居作为一种现代生活方式的代表，受建设成本和消费意识\n的影响很大，因此智能家居的发展还很不平衡。当前智能家居的建设 主要集中在深圳、上海、广州和北京等各沿海城市、直辖市及省级中 心城市的中高端社区。我们通过近期走访一些智能社区楼盘，总结当 前智慧家庭应用现状如下:\n房地产商选择配置智能家居有两大突出的诉求。第一，希望智能 家居系统能提升楼盘品质，同时运营维护成本尽可能低;第二，智能 家居除能为住户提供基本管理功能外，还需能满足住户个性化的家装\n\n需求。 项目实施从分包操作过渡到系统化集成实施。此前，智能家居系\n统中最常见的对讲系统和监控系统需要开发商或总包商分开采购、建 成后由物业管理公司分开运营维护，集成化程度不高。而对开发商和 物业越来越大的系统集成需求，项目集成商正在推广系统化集成实施 和管理方案，即通过一个弱电系统集中管理社区和楼盘。当前智能家 居系统的基本功能一般包括监控、对讲和安防等，高端化的需求包括 水电远程控制、暖通集中控制、智能灯光和智能信息推送等，实施费 用平均 40-200 元 l 平方米不等。\n前装+后装分开操作兼顾到个性化需求，为智慧社区系统升级预 留空间。此前的智能家居系统以总线控制技术为主，通过布线方式控 制灯光和电视等电器，电器安装后不能随意拆改。这类系统无法给住 户提供个性化空间，系统延展性不强。目前的智能家居系统呈现出开 放的趋势，在前装期间把智慧社区、智慧家庭系统的基本架构布局到 家中，预留各种电器、水电和安防设备的端口，住户入住后可以按照 自己的需求适时进行个性化配置。\n\n二、智能家居方兴未艾，前景远大\n1、智能家居是国家和地方政策扶持方向\n近年来，国家政府多次出台与智能家居相关的扶持政策。例如， 在工信部 2024 年发布的《物联网“十四五”发展规划》中，提到着 力提升感知技术、传输技术、处理技术等于智能家居息息相关的物联 网技术，构建物联网标准体系，并将智能家居作为物联网应用重点支 持方向。2024 年 7 月，国家标准化管理委员会通过了闪联提交的新版 家电物联网相关标准 (推荐性标准)，有利于家电接口和互联网标准进 一步统一;2024 年 9 月，发改委等 14 个部位共同发布《国家物联网发 展专项行动计划》，明确提到推动智能家居应用，而向公众对家居安 全性、舒适性、功能多样性需求，在大中城市选择 20 个左右重点社 区，开展 1 万户以上家庭安防、老人及儿童看护、远程家电控制以及 水、电、气智能计量等智能家居示范应用，解决制约规模化推广存在 的产业链协作不足、成本过高、标准不统一等问题，带动智能家居技 术和产品突破，发挥物联网技术优势，提高人民生活质量。\n\n各地方也纷纷制定智慧社区发展规划。如北京、深圳分别计划 2024 年底前智慧社区覆盖 20%, 30%的社区，上海 2024 年计划将运用 物联网技术的智慧社区增至 50 个。\n2、智能家居将步入寻常百姓家 （1）有利背景:用户习惯已培育，地产商投资意愿增强\n智能终端设备普及已培育用户习惯。根据易观智库的数据，2024 年第三季度我国智能 销量达 9300 万台，出货量渗透率由 2Q2024 的 24%已攀升至 90%，保有率渗透率估计过半。根据中怡康统计，2024 年第三季度末我国智能电视也从 2024 年初的不到 10%提升至 52%。 智能终端设备的普及有利于培养用户使用习惯，带动消费者对于智能 家居的接受度。\n地产商精装修趋势明确，投资智能家居意愿增强。当前，国内大\n\n中型城市的精装修率平均在 10-20%。在消费升级和建筑环保趋势下， 精装修房正不断得到市场青睐，越来越多开发商选择采用精装修楼盘 来增强营销竞争力，除恒大和中海外，如滨江集团几乎所有楼盘采用 精装修。商品房精装修的趋势不可逆，而智慧家庭、智慧社区建设有 利于进一步增强楼盘差异化吸引力，地产商的投资意愿正在加强。\n智能化技术演进和行业规模效应带来产品价格逐渐降低。智能家 居解决方案可根据消费者需求提供不同的配置，并对应不同的产品价 格。如当前较为基本和实用的解决方案(新装)一般需要 60-100 元/平 米，豪华型解决方案需要 100-300 元/平米，超豪华型方案可到 300-500 元/平米。未来，随着核心元器件及部件的技术进步及规模效应显现， 智能家居解决方案的性价比将能不断提升，从而增强对用户的吸引 力。 （2）撬动存量市场，产品服务创新涌动\n智能家居市场虽已发展多年，但目前市场需求仍仅集中在工程、 前装领域，消费体验存在产品附加值不高、使用不便、标准不统一等 问题。能否撬动庞大的存量市场是行业做大的关键，产业链各参与方\n\n也正在产品与服务上尝试创新。 创新趋势之一:系统解决方案与单品并重，模块化、标准化便于\n升级。此前的智能家居产品而对前装市场，更多偏重系统解决方案， 而对后装市场对价格和试错敏感的大众消费者，当前有越来越多的公 司侧重推出简洁的单品。如 Nest 的恒温器和烟雾探测器、Wem。的 智能插座等一系列单品，在北美取得了良好的市场反响。此外，为了 便于消费者后续升级，部分产品特意加强产品模块化设计，如国内公 司熊猫管家拟推出的智能路由器，可让用户自由选择是否搭载影音娱 乐、家电控制的模块。\n创新趋势之二:精准打击需求痛点，深度挖掘外观+易用+功能吸 引力。此前的智能家居产品时常而临华而不实、操作复杂的批评，因\n\n此精准打击到用户需求痛点非常重要。当前主要的创新方向包括（: 1） 产品外观，唯有美观的产品才能激发消费者购买欲望，如智慧谷的智 慧瓶将视频监控同艺术花瓶结合在一起;（2）产品易用性，智能家居 人机交互的方向是傻瓜、易用，最终走向人工智能，如能代替用户打 扫房间卫生的自动扫地机较其他产品有更高的好评度和接受度;（3） 产品功能，智能家居绝不仅仅是远程控制，更重要的给消费者带来的 服务价值。当前在家庭环境中尚未被很好满足的需求包括能源管理、 安防、健康护理、教育等均可探索，如 4G 通信技术将大幅提升视频 传输的体验，推动基于智能家居的远程医疗、远程教育等服务普及。\n创新趋势之三:互联网企业介入，商业模式革新存想象空间。互 联网企业是智能家居领域不可忽视的参与力量之一。例如，继获得千 万美元融资的极路由之后，百度、小米等巨头也纷纷进入智能路由器 领域。一方而路由器当前智能化程度较低、另一方而是家庭各种流量 的终极入口，充分挖掘其功能可打开家庭服务的空间，成为互联网企 业必争之地不足为奇。\n互联网企业介入智能家居行业的意义，未必在于其对产品的突破 性创新，而更多在于其互联网营销模式以及通过“硬件+软件+生态 圈”的打法革新商业模式。\n\n3、智能家居有望新增数千亿级别市场空间\n智能家居带来的市场空间主要包括三方而:即工程新建或改造投 资、现有家居产品的升级以及后续服务市场，累计可撬动数千亿级别 市场。\n（1）估计 2024 年智能家居工程投资的市场规模约为 70 亿元， 主要假设为 2024 年全国住宅房屋竣工而积 9.9 亿平米，其中 5%投资 智能家居工程，存量住宅而积约 195 亿平米，其中有 0.1%进行投资智 能家居改造，平均每平米投资均假设为 100 元。未来，随着智能家居 走入千家万户，存量市场被撬动，工程投资市场潜力极大。假设到 2024 年，每年住宅竣工而积中有 50%投资智能家居，存量住宅中有 5%进行智能家居改造投资，平均每平米投资均假设为 50 元，则对应 市场空间高达 1000 亿元。\n\n(2)存量智能家居市场短期指相关产品的智能化升级替换，将主要 体现在家电和照明等领域。根据中怡康推算，2024 年我国家电市场零 售额规模约 1.3 万亿元，其中白电、黑电、厨卫小家电和数码 3C 分 别占 25%,15%,15%和 45%的份额。根据照明电器协会数据，2024 年我 国照明电器内销产值约 1500 亿元。考虑到当前白电、厨卫小家电及 照明电器的网络化和智能化程度低，相当于约 6000 亿元市场的家电 和照明电器存在智能化升级替换空间。\n放 眼 全 球 ， 家 庭 设 备 的 互 联 互 通 也 是 趋 势 。 根 据 Informa Telcom&Media 的预测，至 2024 年全球家庭设备销量将达到 54.9 亿台。 其中，联网设备将突破 18 亿台，渗透率将达 33%，而 2024 年联网设 备的销量渗透率仅 8%。\n（3）围绕智能家居的创新服务将创造新的市场。随着智能家居\n\n系统搭建完毕、现有家居产品陆续完成智能化升级，新的服务模式和 商业模式有了诞生的基础，譬如智慧节能、健康监护、社区购物、安 防监控和综合娱乐教育服务等均可依托智能家居来实现。按城镇 2 亿 户家庭，每户家庭未来在智能家居服务相关年支出 1000 元一 2024 元 估算，对应智能家居服务市场容量可达 2024 4000 亿元。\n三、智能家居技术与标准的现状与趋势\n智能家居必须通过某种物联网技术，将各种与数字化信息相关的 通信设备、家用电器以及家庭保安装置等，联接到同一个家庭智能化 系统上，才可实现对家庭事务的监视、控制和管理。智能家居虽然形 态多变，但物与物相连是共同的前提，因此研究物物互联通讯就十分 必要。\n由于智能家居系统上的各类传感器、控制器乃至家用电器，很多 情况下不一定由同一厂商生产。因此，为了保证系统的扩充性和扩展\n\n性，智能家居在发展中形成了多个通讯技术标准以及相应的标准联 盟。采用同一技术标准设计的系统和产品能够使本系统与未来不断发 展的第三方受控设备进行互通互连。\n1、总线、无线和电力载波三大通讯技术并存\n智能家居内部的网络信息包括采集类信号、设备控制类信号和媒 体信号。数据采集类信号主要是指水、电、燃气和热量的信号采集; 设备控制类信号主要指各种家用电器开关的控制;媒体信号则是音频 和视频类复杂信号的传输。因应这些日益增长且复杂化的需求，实现 智能家居系统的通讯网络架构技术历经不断发展演变。目前，主流技 术总体上可以分为三类:即总线技术、无线技术和电力线载波技术。\n第一类:总线技术。总线技术是最早出现的智能家居技术，其主 要特点是所有设备通信与控制都集中在一条总线上，是一种全分布式 智能控制网络技术，其产品模块具有双向通信能力，以及互操作性和 互换性。\n\n目前，较为成熟且应用广泛的智能家居总线技术有 RS-485, LonWorks, I-bus, C-bus 和 CAN 等。\nRS-485 技术。是出现较早、目前仍很常见的总线技术。采用平衡 发送和差分接收，具有抑制共模干扰的能力。其总线巨议简单，大部 分的智能家居产品都会留有对 RS-485 的接口，以便设备兼容。\nLonWorks 技术。由 Echelon 推出，并由 Motorola 和 Toshiba 等采 用。它通过网络变量把网络通信设计简化为参数设置，支持双绞线、 同轴电缆、光缆和红外线等多种通信介质。\n其最大的特点是不需要主机，而采用神经元网络，安全性和稳定 性突出。\nI-bus 技术。由 ABB 首创，特点是传感器与控制器之间的对应控 制关系不是通过各种复杂的线缆连接实现，而是通过 E 丁 S 编程应用 软件进行定义、组合，再通过接口下载到元件。\nI-bus 是目前技术较为先进、应用较为广泛的总线控制技术，已\n\n经成为国际标准 CISO/IEC14543-3)，并于 2024 年成为中国国标 G B/Z 20965。\nCAN 技术。起初是 BOSC 日为现代汽车应用而推出的一种多主 机局部网，其特点是废除了传统的站地址编码，而代之以对通信数据 块进行编码，从而使网络内的节点个数在理论上不受限制。这种按数 据块编码的方式，还可使不同的节点同时接收到相同的数据，保证了 通信的实时性。CAN 由于其可靠性和独特的设计，因此被业界认为 是最有前途的总线技术之一。\n第二类:无线技术。由光缆或电缆构成的有线网络有其明显的缺 点，譬如布线或改线工程量大，成本费用高以及网络中各节点不可移 动等。因此，近年来，无线技术应用于智能家居的趋势越来越明显。\n无线方式种类繁多，实现方式也多种多样，所以实际运用中可供 选择的方案也很多。主流的智能家居无线技术主要有以下几类:\nZig Bee 技术。ZigBee 联盟成立于 2024 年 8 月，由英国 Nlvensys、\n\n日本三菱电气、美国摩托罗拉以及荷兰飞利浦半导体等公司组成，已 经吸引上百家芯片厂、无线设备公司和开发商加入，是应用最为广泛 的无线技术。ZigBee 的特点是数据传输速率低(只 10k 字节/秒到 250k 字节/秒)、功耗低、有效覆盖范围小(10100 米)以及工作频段灵活 (2.4GHz, 868MHz 及 915MHz)。\nZ-Wave 技术。是由丹麦公司 Zensys 主导的无线组网规格。Z-wave 联盟的成员均是已经在智能家居领域有成熟产品的厂商，包括 Cisco, Intel 和微软等 160 多家国际知名公司。\nZ-Wave 技术专门为智能家居无线控制而研发，采用动态路由技 术和小数据格式传输。\nW LAN 技术。始于 20 世纪 80 年代中期，是由美国联邦通信委 员会为工业、科研和医学(ISM)频段的公共应用提供授权而产生的。W LAN 遵守 EIEE802.11 标准，其规范包括红外线(较少使用)，跳频扩 频 HSS 和直接序列扩频 DSSS 等方案。WLAN IEEE802.11 是 LAN 以 太网的无线延伸。EIEE802.11 设备的优点是能够支持复杂的媒体存储 控制特征，如节点隐藏和应用点间的漫游等。\nRF 无线射频技术。基于 RF 技术构建的智能家居系统主要包括一 个家庭网关和若干个通讯子节点。在家庭网关和每个无线通讯子节点 都配置无线收发模块，数据和控制信息在网关和各子节点之间进行传 送。相对而言，RF 技术成熟度高、成本低廉，且穿透性好。\n蓝牙技术。是由蓝牙 SIG 于 2024 年发起提出的。SIG 最初是由 旧 M 和 Intel 等公司组成，目前已经达到两千多家。在业务支持上，\n\n蓝牙规范同时支持数据业务和语音业务的传输。 工作模式上，蓝牙设备可以有两种选择，既主设备或从设备。主\n设备负责设定跳频序列，从设备必须与主设备保持同步。组网方式上， 蓝牙规范支持微微网和散射网两种模式，但对前者，一个主设备所支 持的从设备不超过 7 个。多个微微网可以通过节点桥接的方式构成散 身寸网。\n第三类:电力线载波技术。电力线载波技术属于一种广义上的总 线技术。不过，由于其具有与其他总线技术所不具备的鲜明特点，即 无需布线、而是通过在现有的电力线上加装调制解调器，以 50Hz 交 流电为载波，以数百 KHz 的脉冲为调制信号，实现信号的传输与控 制。\n因此，我们在接下来的讨论中将其单独划分为一类技术。最早出 现的电力线载波技术是 X-10,之后陆续发展出 ApBus, PLCBus 和 OFDM 等电力线载波技术。\n\nX-10 技术。历史最长且使用最简单的一种电力线载波技术，由 美国的 Pico Electronics 公司于 1978 年研发。X10 以 60 日 z(或 50Hz) 为载波，以 120Hz 的脉冲为调变波进行数字控制，信号的传输是利用 市电电源的正弦信号的过零点来进行的。X-10 直接利用住宅电\n力线作为控制总线，电力线将电能传到家中的各个房间，同时也 将家中所有的电灯、电器连成网络，通过电力线将各控制器与各功能 接口器相连并实现程序控制。X-10 技术是目前美国智能家居产品的 主要领导者，在欧洲、日本、新加坡和韩国等地也有广泛应用。X-10 最大的弱点在于抗干扰性能差，对电力线通信信道环境的稳定性要求 较高。\nCEBus 技术。为了解决 X-10 技术上的不足，美国电子工业巨会 的消费电子小组在 1992 年正式推出家庭中使用的消费产品的网络通 讯标准，命名为消费电子总线 CEBus (Consumer Electronic Bus)，并确 定为 IS-60/EIA-600 标准。CEBus 是一个较完整的开放系统，它定义 了在几乎所有传送媒体中信号的传输标准，并要求控制信号在所有媒 体中都要以相同的传送速度(10kbps>传送，从而有效地避免信号传输\n\n中可能出现的瓶颈问题。任何符合 CEBus 标准的电器产品都可以直 接互连及通信，其寻址能力超过 40 亿，足可以与互联网相媲美。CEBus 的抗干扰能力比 X-10 强，控制功能也十分丰富，支持的媒介有电力 线、红外线、无线电、双绞线和同轴电缆等。不同的媒介能满足不同 设备对通讯量的要求。例如对于低速的控制信号可以通过电源线和红 外线，对于大量的和实时的视频数据信号可以通过同轴电缆，这样就 使得控制信号和数据信号分开，提高了通信的快速性和可靠性。(Bus 的劣势在于其接口技术比较复杂，价钱也相对较贵，因此市场份额并 不高。\nPLC-Bus 技术。同样是对 X-10 技术的升级，由荷兰 ATS 电力线 通信研发，并由于其技术的革新获得多项专利。PLC-Bus 技术重新定 义了家庭内部高可靠、低成本智能灯光控制的新标准，拥有很强的系 统稳定性和可靠性，为商业住宅提供了更为经济的智能化控制解决方 案。PLC-Bus 技术在欧洲智能家居市场的占有率已达到四成以上。\nOFDM 技术。即正交频分复用技术，从美国军方的多载波调制 系统发展而来，核心思想是将信道分成若干正交子信道，把高速数据 信号转换成并行的低速子数据流，调制到在每个子信道上进行传输。 正交信号可以通过在接收端采用相关技术来分开，这样可以减少子信 道之间的相互干扰。该技术的主要劣势在于其信号是由多个独立的经 过调制的子载波信号相加而成的，这样的合成信号就有可能产生比较 大的峰值功率，导致较大的峰值均值功率比，从而使射频放大器的功 率效率较低。OFDM 技术的代表厂商有中国的东软载波，但其尚未\n\n大规模应用于智能家居行业，需要经受市场检验。\n2、不同通讯技术各有优、劣势，服务不同层次市场 这三类智能家居通讯技术经过多年的发展，已经各自分别衍生出\n多种技术标准。这些技术标准从大类而言都还有共通而鲜明的优势和 劣势。在下表中，我们从安装、成本、可靠性和可扩充性等多角度分 别进行了归纳。\n总线技术类产品及方案比较适合于智能建筑和智能小区等较大 区域的控制，而且由于其需要布线，安装复杂，工期较长，因而适用 新装修用户，尤其是别墅、高级酒店和高档写字楼;无线技术类产品 及方案的主要优势在于无需布线，安装方便，易于扩充，成本较低，\n\n对新装修用户和旧房改造用户都适用;电力线载波技术产品及方案综 合优势十分明显:无需布线，仅利用既有电力网，即可实现家居智能 化改造，成本较低，并且没有无线技术可能带来的辐射问题;其最大 的劣势在于过去的电力线载波技术对供电网络环境要求较高，因此限 制了该技术在用电环境相对恶劣(例如电压不稳定)的国内大规模推 广。不过，东软载波以 OFDM 技术为基础自主研发的载波芯片已经 发展到第五代，已经能够在国内复杂电网环境下全而应用于智能家居 建设。\n从成本角度而言，无线技术和电力线载波技术优势较明显。目前 一套 100-150 平米的三居室，如采用无线技术或电力线载波技术配置 智能家居系统，总费用已经可以控制在万元以内，并且价格仍有进一 步下行的趋势。产品和系统价格越来越亲民，这是智能家居走进普通 住宅的最基本的驱动因素。\n3、技术标准发展趋势:竞争与融合并存，市场检验才是致胜关键 智能家居的通讯和控制技术多种多样，涵盖的产品和系统极为广\n泛，对应的行业监管职能也分散于建设、公安和工信等多部门，并没\n\n有一个统一和强制性的智能家居的标准。 从国外经验来看，智能家居的标准都是由主导企业发起，再由采\n用统一标准的联盟完善、确认并推广的，没有国家和地区的强制性标 准。目前，我国没有智能家居领域的强制性标准。\n在原信息产业部的支持下曾经制定和发布了 E 家佳和闪联两个 推荐性标准。E 家佳由海尔集团主导成立，主要由白电企业参与，标 准侧重于家庭控制子网络，即集中控制各种家用电器并接入互联网; 而闪联则由联想牵头成立，主要包括黑电企业，侧重各种 3C 设备的 智能互联与资源共享，相当于家庭 IP 子网络。两大标准各有侧重， 并不冲突。除此之外，我国对总线技术和电力线载波技术应用于智能 家居系统尚未推出相关标准。\n我们认为，技术标准之间的竞争，并不是阻碍智能家居行业发展 的瓶颈或者障碍。相反地，这些竞争具体体现在不同智能家居系统的 成本、稳定性和舒适度等各项指标，能够分别满足不同层次智能家居 的需求，从而共同促进智能家居产业的发展壮大。智能家居系统将会 采用何种技术也并不一定是非此即彼的，理想状态下可根据组网环境 条件、设备具体需求的不同，由控制中枢兼容多种传输介质和控制手 段，对组网设备实现灵活的通信和控制。\n长远看，不同类技术和同类技术下的不同标准有融合发展的趋 势，市场将是决定标准存在和最终胜出的主导因素。预计随着标准的 逐渐完善和市场的自然选择，两大标准(以及未来还可能出现的其他 标准)将相辅相成、共同支撑未来的智能家居系统。\n\n四、智能家居产业链投资逻辑\n1、产业链参链条长，集成商互相渗透做大市场\n从产业链的角度看，智能家居产业链主要包含零部件商、终端设 备商、系统集成商、网络和内容服务提供商等，产业链链条长。\n由于智能家居系统中所包含的子系统较多，因此各个子系统领域 的参与方均在向智能家居产业延伸与渗透，尝试以智能家居领域集成 商的身份进行市场推广，如中控行业的 Honeywell, Control4,照明电工 行业的 ABB，家电与视听设备行业的海尔、TCL、长虹、LG 和索尼， 安防行业的安居宝，通信行业的思科、中国电信和中国移动等。\n众人拾柴火焰高，更多的产业链参与方纷纷渗透将更有助于培育 消费者习惯，激发出市场潜力。\n\n2、中期看系统集成商，长期看服务商，零部件企业或有弹性\n首先，产业链的繁荣有赖于消费兴起，而当前制约消费者体验的 瓶颈环节在系统集成环节，系统集成商是中期内最有价值的产业链参 与方。当前的系统集成商中除了少数知名企业以外，多数都是小型公 司，有的挂靠科研院所，有的挂靠工程企业，其资金能力、项目经验 以及与房地产开发商、工程商的合作实力都明显不足。成熟的系统集 成商将具备产品、渠道和服务壁垒。智慧家庭和智慧社区搭建的定制 性较高，系统集成商在与地产商、物业所有者和管理者以及与消费者 对接过程中积累的项目经验与资源、定制化产品和服务安装人员将筑 起进入壁垒。我们预计系统集成商最终将强者恒强，当前同时具备 B2B/B2C 渠道推广优势、服务优势和资源整合优势的公司将占据先\n\n机。 其次，服务提供商最具长期价值，核心是对服务和商业模式的创\n新。一方而，从时间上来说，智慧家庭与智慧社区硬件普及与升级先 行，网络和内容服务提供商的价值将在硬件普及后逐渐显现;另一方 而，从所创造价值来说，智能家居系统的构建为一次性投入，但其后 续服务可持续创造收入流，长期看所创造的价值可能更大。可能进入 该领域的包括智能家居系统集成商、互联网企业、电信服务商等，其 中三大电信巨头目前在智能家居领域仍以提供宽带网络为核心盈利 模式，未来也有机会进军智能家居领域成为服务提供商。\n最后，部分零部件商和终端商的业务可能具备弹性。随着智慧家 庭和智慧社区的发展加速，相关硬件产品的销售放量，必将带动上游 零部件产业的发展。智能家居产品上游零部件主要包括显示模块、镜 头、IC,晶体管、电阻、芯片、传感器、嵌入式语音操控模块以及通 讯模块等。\n从产品角度看，当前最需突破瓶颈的环节未来可能最具弹性。智 能家居硬件产品需具备三大属性:\n（1）可感知性，即需要通过传感器捕捉各种信息。如捕捉环境 中的温度、湿度、照度、一氧化碳浓度、火情和经纬度等信息，捕捉 物体的信息如家电能源消耗、食物保质期等，以及捕捉人体或动物的 信息如声音、动作、体征状态、健康状态和运动状态等。传感器(也 包括人机交互设备、可穿戴设备等)等当前尚未大规模应用于大众市 场，未来或具备很大弹性;\n\n（2）可联网，对应各类通信类芯片和设备的开发。如高通近期 也发布了而向智能家居的网络处理器芯片，主打低功耗、高性能的无 线通讯技术。由于通信芯片类产品的应用和创新主战场多在智能 及 IT 产品上，预计若产品创新未突破，智能家居为其带来的弹性相 对较小。路由器智能化创新过程中关注企业级路由器龙头星网锐捷;\n（3）智能性，对应智能家居中枢智能化，涉及人工智能、云计 算等软件领域。人工智能、云计算本身也处发展初期，且其潜在应用 领域广泛不仅限于智能家居，长期可持续关注。\n\n五、重点公司简况\n综上，从投资策略看，我们认为智能家居产业链投资逻辑可按三 条线索展开:\n系统集成商是中期内最有价值的产业链参与方。智能家居产业链 的繁荣有赖于消费兴起，而当前消费者体验的提升环节在系统集成。 未来具备 B2B 和 B2C 综合渠道推广优势、业务优势和资源整合优势 的公司将占据先机。譬如家电领域的青岛海尔，安防领域的安居宝， 由电力载波芯片领域向集成商拓展的东软载波以及由智能会议和智 能建筑领域布局切入智能家居的飞利信等，此外，达实智能作为项目 施工方也将受益，而四川长虹基于传感技术应用的智能家居战略布局 蓄势待发。\n(2)零部件商可能具备较高弹性，标的寻找主线可遵循智能家居 产品须具备可感知性 (对应各类传感器)、可联}呼险(对应各类通信组 件)以及智能性(对应人工智能、石计算等)，投资标的包括提供语音人 机交互软硬件的科大讯飞、气体传感器龙头汉威电子以及提供智能家\n\n居控制中枢设备的路由器龙头星网锐捷。 (3)服务提供商未来有望实现后端收入，具备长期价值，其成功的\n核心因素将是对服务和商业模式的创新。潜在标的包括谋划借助广电 渠道进入智能家居服务领域的捷成股份、同洲电子、已涉足家庭视听 娱乐的互联网企业乐视网和百视通等。\n注:股价为 2024 年 11 月 29 日收盘价\n1、系统集成商 （1）青岛海尔：智能家居盈利模式清晰，领先优势明显布局长远\n智能家居业务蛰伏十年，产品+标准+系统三位一体。青岛海尔 专注智能家居领域超过 10 年，目前具备智能产品+系统集成+行业标 准的全方位覆盖综合实力。公司通过开放式研发平台打造的智能家电 陆续进入零售市场，产品智能化程度不断加深;中国智能家展会位于 青岛海尔总部，公司作为发起人成立的“e 家佳”智能家电联盟，目 前已经有产业链上下游、国内外 300 多家企业的加入，强化了在行业 标准方而的话语权;在产品和标准的基础上，海尔还具备系统集成能 力，海尔智能家居系统按照平台化思路打造，相较其他品牌的系统，\n\n具有开放性、兼容性、延展性、可靠性的优势。 以工程市场作为切入点，业务渐入收获期。智能家电涉及千亿级\n别市场空间，家电产品升级、弱电设备升级是企业的内在动力，智能 设备普及、地产项目升值是外部催化。公司目前以楼盘项目实施为主， 预计 2024 年公司完成楼盘项目 15 个，实现收入约 5 亿元。智能家居 产品向深度智能化发展，应用范围从智慧家庭向智慧社区扩展，这两 个维度的延伸将打破未来产品和市场的边界。\n商业模式:目前定位为系统集成商，前装楼盘智能系统实施+后装 满足住户个性化需求。\n前装市场一一公司通过项目招标承接楼盘/社区系统实施工程， 项目成本 40-200 元/平米，主要涵盖监控、安防、灯光、楼宇对讲等 功能，每户预置好智能控制终端;后装市场—住户根据资金预算和个 性化需求，将需要智能控制的终端硬件接入到预置好的智能控制终端 上。\n海尔的优势包括:第一，技术储备早，智能产品成熟度高，拥有 全系列的智能家电;第二，标准背书，是智能家电标准的核心推动者;

”，毫无疑问，任何文选都是有思想性的，但作为语文教学能讲，还必须通\n过文选这一载体，来“训练学生运用语言文字的能力和良好习惯”，所谓文道结合\n的原则就是这个道理。\n第四、教材是例子。比较各个学科，语文课不同于其他的课：数学、物理、化\n学等课本，材料是一定的，各科的“教学大纲”都规定好了，语文课本的材料是课\n文，课文实际上是举例的性质，教师要善于利用教材举一反三，绝对不能就教材讲\n教材，要善于引导学生利用文本举一反三，通过对文本的学习形成较好的听说读写\n能力。《课程标准》指出：“教材要有开放性和弹性。在合理安排基本课程内容的\n基础上，给地方、学校和教师留有开发、选择的空间，也为学生留出选择和拓展的\n空间，以满足不同学生学习和发展的要。” 讲的道理是一样的。\n文言是指以先秦口语为基础而形成的上古汉语书面语言以及后来历代作家\n仿古的作品中的语言。文言文，也就是用文言写成的文章，即上古的文言作品以\n及历代模仿它的作品。文言文作为一种定型化的书面语言，沿用了两三千年，从\n先秦诸子、两汉辞赋、史传散文，到唐宋古文、明清八股……都属于文言文的范\n围。那怎样让学生能真正地理解文言文呢？本人对文言文教学的理解是：\n一、教师首先要加强自身文言文素质修养。\n知识的迅速更新，学生获取信息渠道的加宽，要求教师加强自身修养，提高\n自身素质。语文课堂的闭塞，教学方法的不能运用自如，很大程度上源于知识量\n的偏狭。韩愈《师说》曾经说过：“师者，所以传道授业解惑也”，教师不明道，\n怎能“传道”？教师无学业，怎能“授业”？教师不能深入了解知识的精蕴，又怎能\n解学生之惑？人们常说教师要给学生一杯水，自己必须有一桶水。现在要求教师\n要有源源不竭的泉水，如果教师自己只有一杯水，那怎能为人师呢？由于文化传\n媒的多样化和教学手段的现代化，学生从各种渠道摄取了大量的知识和信息，而\n我们教师如果仅仅依靠一本参考书来面对莘莘学子，又怎能不捉襟见肘呢？“学\n高人之师”的古训，“名师出高徒”的俗语，都生动地说明学识是对教师素质的基\n本要求。作为一名语文教师，必须多读书，读好书，加强自身修养，提高素质。\n二、教师讲解剖析要准确简明，翻译断句要深入浅出。\n学生的主体性要求一直被摆在突出的位置，而在目前越来越得到重视、倡导\n和培养，因此今后在学习文言文的过程中，要充分注重学生自主学习的要求，重\n在培养学生的自主阅读理解能力与应用能力等素质，破去传统教学的一些不良因\n素，让学生逐渐地成为真正的学习主体。学生能够理解掌握的、有较清楚注释的，\n比如年号、地名、人名、某些特有词汇等，可以让学生自己查找识记或讨论，有\n争议和无法确定的，教师再予以指导、排除疑难。学习文言文，笔者认为最要紧\n最关键的一点，在于形成“文言文中的字词基本可以看做是一个字等于一个词”\n的观点意识。这是文言文和其它语体文章相比最为突出的一个特殊性，相信不少\n朋友应该深有体会。文言文产生于古代，时代环境不同，语义、用法殊为不同。\n总的说来，学习实词含义、虚词用法、特殊句式以及一些文言文常识是学习文言\n文的基本内容，而掌握字、词、义是教与学的核心任务，必须以词汇为中心来组\n织文言文的教与学。学生学习文言文困难与否，常常取决于词义的讲析，词义讲\n析得好，那么断句、翻译等任务就可以进行得较为顺利。所以，在文言文教与学\n过程中，讲解剖析要求准确简明，翻译断句要求深入浅出。\n三、教师要加强诵读指导，培养学生的语感。\n“熟读唐诗三百首，不会做诗也会吟”，“书读百遍，其义自见”，这些流传千\n古的名言，总结了古人宝贵的治学经验。朗读和背诵是中华民族学习语文的优秀\n传统，是训练学生语感的一条重要途径。现在，在课程改革的背景下，课程标准\n又一次明确提出了“能用普通话正确、流利、有感情地朗读课文，是朗读的总要\n求。”朗读是一种教学方法，也是一个学习过程，蕴涵着智慧和规律，熔铸着真\n诚和情感。它是一个实实在在的教学过程，而不是一种简单的课堂形式，它需要\n我们用心去研究和设计。教无定法，读亦无定法，但朗读最终目的是要为阅读教\n学的实际服务。初中学生学习文言文乃为启蒙，没有文言文语感，文字生疏，且\n无停顿断句常识，要学好文言文就必须加强朗读指导。朗读时，人的脑、眼、耳、\n口等各种器官协调配合，又各司其职。这些器官在生理运动状态中，又处于理性\n感悟状态。运动中感悟渐趋加深，感悟中运动更为有效。在这种交融状态中，便\n会逐步形成一种良好的悟性感觉。这种感觉便是语感效应。在初中文言文阅读教\n学中，应当少分析讲解，多挤出一些时间指导学生朗读精彩语段。朗读的过程是\n体验和感悟的过程。所谓“书读百遍，其义自见”，就是这个道理。关键是要指导\n学生真正读进去，读出味，读出情。读的方式要多种多样，可分为领读、齐读、\n分角色读、自读、默读等。根据读的内容和时机灵活运用，使学生始终处于一种\n积极兴奋的诵读状态，读来如见其人，如闻其声，如临其景，如历其事，享受语\n文带来无穷的乐趣。苏东坡也曾说过：“旧书不厌百回读，熟读精思子自知”。学\n生在粗明字句的基础上，通过反复诵读，能从中体味语言的气势和语文的情味，\n逐步形成敏锐的语感，进而接受作品中人文精神的教育。\n四、教师要注重文言文的现代意识。\n站在现代人的角度去诠释古文，可以激发学生学习的积极性，并可以培养学\n生关心政治、关心社会生活的自觉性。对学生树立正确的人生观、世界观、价值\n观也能起到良好的导向作用。古老的话题，用现代意识、现代故事去诠释，学生\n从中所吸收的人生感悟必将会对他产生深刻的影响。例如在讲授孟子的《王何必\n曰利》时，充分利用现代社会中有关义利的故事加深学生对文章内容及孟子思想\n的理解，也更好地引导学生明确孟子义利观对我国当今社会主义现代化建设的积\n极意义。\n古诗文是我国古代优秀文化的宝贵遗产。初中课本中的古诗文，几乎遍涉古\n文经典。从先秦诸子到唐宋散文；从《诗经》到唐诗宋词元曲……虽只是浩瀚的\n文学海洋的点滴，却是中华文化的沉沉载体，它们如同一条源远流长的大河，脉\n脉相承，孕育了一代又一代优秀人才。\n《高中语文课程标准》指出：选修课也是基础教育课程的一部分。设计选修课的目的在\n于更好地让学生有选择地学习，为学生有个性的发展奠定基础。\n先秦时期是我国思想文化取得辉煌成就的时期，出现了许多学派，他们的论著代表着中\n华文化精神，对后世发生了极其深远的影响。开设《先秦诸子论著选读》课程，对继承和发\n扬我国优秀文化遗产，体会中华文化的博大精深，增进学生的思想道德修养，形成积极健康\n的人生观和价值观，培养好学深思的探究态度，具有十分重要的意义。\n本课程的开设方式，是采用综合性的模块，是从先秦诸子各学派代表人物的著作中，选\n择有代表性的文章或是片段，进行阅读探究。在教学中，我们要善于引导学生通过学习、阅\n读和分析文本，体会诸子言论以及文章的妙处，感受他们的深刻思想和智慧。要把先秦诸子\n的学习，跟学生面临或关注的人生问题结合起来，启发学生多做相关性的思考。要引导学生\n对所学内容进行讨论和交流，充分挖掘先秦诸子那些具有艺术魅力的要素，把先秦诸子的学\n习和语文必修课的学习有机地结合起来。\n教学目标\n1、学习选文，积累文言字词句和写法方面的知识。\n2、较为系统地了解孔子的思想，尤其是了解他对社会人生问题的思考。\n3、从孔子的思想和思考中找到立身处世的借鉴。\n教学重点\n本单元内容共有七节，每一节基本围绕一个主题来选择和编排《论语》中的材料，所选\n择的材料往往是学习古代汉语的经典篇章，而且具有很高的鉴赏价值。第一节是讲孔子勇于\n担当社会责任的精神。第二节讲孔子与弟子之间的关系。第三节讲孔子的生存智慧。第四节\n讲孔子的“仁”的学说。第五节讲孔子对“义”的坚守。第六节讲孔子的教育思想和教育方\n法。第七节讲孔子“学”这一概念的特殊意义。本单元采用现在这种形式编排，是为了使学\n生对《论语》及孔子有一系列专题性的了解，也是为了把《论语》中最精华的部分呈现给学\n生。\n教学难点\n对于孔子和《论语》，学生较熟悉，他们在初中学过《<论语>十则》，高中必修一的“名\n著导读”部分，把《论语》列为必读的内容。特别是近年来，许多省市的高考把《论语》列\n为必考“三大文化经典”之一，学生很重视。所以，学习本单元，学生不仅有基础，而且有\n需要。但是，《论语》内容言简意丰，博大精深，学生理解存在一定困难，需要老师有效地\n指导。\n教学设计\n一、《天下有道，丘不与易也》\n本课主要讲孔子勇于担当社会责任的精神。因为天下无道，孔子才跟自己的弟子们不知\n辛苦地四处奔波，为社会改革而不懈努力。但是同一个时代，却有许多人不理解他，甚至嘲\n笑他。本文主要写孔子与隐士之间的矛盾，重点学习“子路问津”和“子路从而后”两则\n选文。\n先“子路问津”的教学，这一则着重指导学生弄懂桀溺说的话和孔子所的话的意思。\n桀溺说的话中意思有两层：一层是说，天下到处都像洪水横流一般的混乱，你同谁去改\n变它呢？另一层是说，你子路与其追随孔子这种避人之士，为什么不跟着我们这些避世之士，\n出世而隐居呢？\n孔子的话也有两层意思：一个是说，人不可以跟鸟兽同群，自己只会跟世间众生在一起；\n他要告诉桀溺等人：自己只会生活在世间众生之中。另一个是说，自己之所以要改变这个世\n界，是因为天下没有德政。他要告诉桀溺等人：天下越是混乱自己越不会选择避世。\n其中关于桀溺的细节描写，表达了他瞧不起孔子师徒人生选择的神态，非常传神。\n学习“子路从而后”，主要理解子路最后所说的话的意思。子路说老人知道长幼之间的\n礼节是不可废弃的，但是他选择了隐居躬耕，这说明他废弃了君臣之义。老人想要保持自身\n的清白，却违背了君臣之间的根本伦理原则。子路认为，君子做官是为了行义而非谋利。子\n路的话代表了孔子的意思，体现了孔子在推行道义方面的执著精神。其中关于荷蓧丈人的细\n节描写，表达了他瞧不起孔子师徒的神态，非常传神。\n为了帮助学生更好地理解，我们可以提出以下两个问题，引导学生深入思考和讨论：\n第一个问题：孔子跟长沮、桀溺以及荷蓧丈人一类的人物有什么不同？\n第二个问题：我们应当怎样评价孔子“知其不可而为之”的精神？\n文中的其他三则，可以灵活处理。或是在课上讲解，或是课后布置自学。\n本课要掌握的关键字词：“问津”的“津”字，“辟人之士”的“辟”字，“遇丈人”的\n“丈人”，“以杖荷蓧”的“荷”字以及“使子路反见之”的“反”字。以上是第一节教学的\n内容和设计。\n二、《当仁，不让于师》\n本课主要讲孔子与弟子的关系。本课共有13则选文，内容繁杂，其中第10则在《中\n国古代诗歌散文欣赏》中学过，我们不做重点讲授。其余12则可以提三个问题，引导学生\n思考：\n1、在弟子眼中，孔子是一位什么样的人？重点学习第1则和第3则。\n第1则是写子贡赞扬孔子的才德是太阳月亮，是别人无法超越与诋毁的。在自贡心中，\n孔子是崇高而伟大的。\n第3则是写颜渊对孔子的赞誉。在颜渊眼中，孔子是学识渊博、施教有法、学问高深的。\n2、孔子与弟子是如何相处的？重点学习第7则、第8则。\n第7则写孔子跟子游开“杀鸡焉用牛刀”的玩笑，主要表现他诙谐幽默的性格。\n第8则写孔子在子路面前发誓的故事。一个老师在学生面前赌咒，那种憨态可掬的样子，\n充分表现了孔子可亲可敬的一面。\n可见，孔子跟弟子之间的关系是民主平等，融洽和谐的。\n3、孔子是如何关爱弟子的？重点学习第9则、第11则和第13则。\n这是本课教学的重点。\n第11则是写孔子对身患“恶疾”的伯牛的无限关爱。伯牛得的是麻风病，这是一种慢\n性传染病，患此病者常常遭人嫌弃，可是孔子对伯牛却毫不嫌弃。其中“自牖握其手”的细\n节描写，生动地表现出孔子对伯牛的无限关爱之情。\n第9则写孔子对颜渊安贫乐道精神的赞扬，第13则是写孔子为颜渊之死而痛哭不已。\n这两则在内容上不难理解，但在写法上却有许多精妙之处，老师要做适当指导。\n比如说第9则，在28个字中，“回也”重复了三次，“贤哉”重复两次，这充分表达出\n孔子对颜渊的赞美之情。其中“人不堪其忧”，是用反衬的方法，加倍赞叹颜渊这种“不改\n其乐”的可贵精神。\n又比如说第13则，在26个字中，“恸”字出现了四次，足见孔子悲伤的程度。这段文\n字虽然很短，却写得非常曲折、非常沉重。颜渊去世，孔子哭得异常悲伤。弟子们实在看不\n下去，就劝他说，老师您哭得太伤心！没想到，他竟然反问说，我哀痛过度了吗？大家想想，\n一个人悲痛到这种程度，自己却不知，这是何等的悲痛！为弟子之死而悲痛到这种程度，可\n见孔子对弟子的关爱之深。也许正是这样的感情，才博得弟子发自内心的爱戴。孔子对弟子\n的爱如此地深厚、如此地真挚，让我们深受感动，仰慕不已！\n本课关键字词如下：重点字词是“夫子矢之”的“矢”字，“自牖握其手”的“牖”字，\n“人不堪其忧”的“堪”字。\n三、第三节《知之为知之，不知为不知》\n本课主要讲孔子的生存智慧。所选12则主要分为五个方面：第1则、第2则讲如何对\n待无知、第3、4、5则讲如何对待过错、第7则是说如何责己责人、第8则是说如何做事、\n在第9则、10则谈如何对待诚信的问题。其中，对待诚信的问题是教学重点。\n下面重点谈谈关于“诚信”问题的教学。\n在第9则中，孔子说，对个人来说，诚信是处世之本。人不讲诚信，就失去了立身处世\n的根本。\n在第10则中，孔子认为政府如果失去了人民的信任，就不可能稳固。“民无信不立”，\n诚信是社会和谐相处、共同发展的根本。对于社会而言，诚信则是政府有效运作的根本。\n孔子非常重视诚信，但是孔子所说的诚信不是没有条件的，而是有前提的，那就是不违\n背道义。在教学中，教师要充分利用课后习题二所选的《史记•孔子世家》中关于孔子对待\n“诚信”的故事，然后引导学生归纳孔子所说“诚信”的原则，那就是讲诚信不能违背道义。\n如果教学时间允许，建议让学生选择其中的一点联系生活实际，谈谈自己的看法。\n四、第四节《己所不欲，勿施于人》\n本课主要讲孔子的“仁”的含义。关于什么是“仁”，孔子对颜渊、子贡、樊迟、仲弓\n等人的回答各有侧重、各不相同，教学中要结合具体选文加以归纳分析。主要学习第1则、\n第2则、第5则选文。\n第1则是写颜渊和孔子关于什么是仁的问答。理解的关键在于“克己复礼”四个字。什\n么是“克己复礼为仁”呢？孔子认为，克制自己，回复到礼的规定，就是仁。仁是内在的观\n念，礼是仁的一种外在表现形式。这一点，学生可能在理解上有一定困难，老师要及时加以\n指导。礼不是人的本性所固有的，但是礼却是社会所必须的。每个人都放任自己的本性而不\n立足于礼，社会就会混乱。所以，人只有克制自己，回复到礼，才能使社会变得有序和谐。\n第2则是写孔子回答仲弓的问仁。本则中，孔子从“敬”“恕”“忠”三个方面回答仲弓\n的问题。孔子提到的“己所不欲，勿施于人”，主要从否定的方面说明仁意味着将心比心、\n推己及人，告诉人们不能干什么。\n第5则是写子贡和孔子关于什么是仁的问答。孔子提到的“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达\n人”，主要从肯定的方面说明将心比心、推己及人，告诉人们应该干什么。\n结合樊迟问仁，我们就可以对孔子的“仁”的含义做一下归纳：从自处的角度看，孔子\n所说的“仁”意味着克服一已之私，而遵循礼的规定。从处世的角度看，“仁”就是就是爱\n人，就是设身处地地体贴人。\n选文的第7、8、9则主要讲对待仁的态度。孔子及其弟子认为，志士仁人要把实现仁、\n成就仁当做人生最高的生存价值和精神目标来追求。内容不难，加以点拨即可。\n本课关键字词有：“克己复礼”的“克”字，“天下归仁”的“归”字，“请事斯语矣”\n的“事”字，“在家无怨”的“家”字，“济众”的“济”字，“尧舜其犹病诸”的“病”字，\n“不仁者不可以久处约”的“约”字。\n五、第五节《不义而富且贵，于我如浮云》\n本课主要讲孔子对“义”的坚守。其中富贵与道义的关系是本课教学的重点。主要学习\n第1则、第3则、第4则。\n第1则选文是说对待富贵的态度。孔子认为只要合于道义，富贵就可以追求；不合于道\n义，富贵就不能追求。孔子不反对做官，不反对发财，但他把追随道义放在求福谋利之上。\n孔子强调，君子忧道不忧贫，对物质利益的追求不是君子的最高追求，道的实行比谋取富贵\n财利更重要。\n第3则选文是说快乐观和富贵观。学习这一则的关键是如何理解贫寒简单生活的快乐所\n在。孔子何以能达到贫而乐，视不义之富贵如浮云呢？关键在于孔子一生致力于“道”的追\n求。在孔子那里，感到快乐的不是贫寒、简单的生活，而是在贫寒、简单的生活中坚持实践\n道义。\n第4则选文说的是富贵与道义的关系。孔子认为对财富和显贵的追求，是人的本性。追\n求富贵或抛弃贫贱，都要符合道义。在孔子看来，作为君子，无论在何时、无论在什么情况\n下，都要坚持仁德践行仁德。\n孔子强调将“义”置于“富贵”之上，这种思想对后世影响极大，直到今天我们仍然可\n以感受到这种影响的存在，教学中引导学生结合各自了解的社会现象来谈感受。\n本课关键字词有：“富而可求也”的“而”字，“饭疏食饮水”的“饭”字和“水”字。\n六、第六节《有教无类》，主要内容是孔子的教育思想和教育方法。学生课外自学。\n七、第七节《好仁不好学，其弊也愚》\n本课主要讲孔子“学”这一概念的特殊意义。重点学习第4则、第6则、第7则、第\n11则选文。\n孔子以好学自许，选文第3则就说到这个问题。但是，他所说的“学”跟我们现在常说\n的不同。\n第4则选文，提到了“六言”和“六弊”。所谓“六言”，指的是“仁”“知”“信”“直”\n“勇”“刚”等六种德行；所谓“六弊”指的是“愚”“荡”“贼”“绞”“乱”“狂”等六种弊\n病。孔子认为，一个人如果偏执于德行而不好学，就会产生种种弊端，好学就可以防止这些\n弊病。这意味着他所说的“学”，主要是一种道德修养，简单地说，学的基本内容是学礼、\n修身。\n第6则选文记录子夏的话，说的是先学德而后学文的学习观。子夏认为，一个人能够尊\n重贤德之人，孝顺父母，尽忠君主，取信朋友，就是学习过的人。可见，他所说的学的内涵\n主要是指品行修养方面。\n第7则选文记录孔子的话，说的还是“什么是好学”的问题。孔子认为，一个好学的人\n要做到尚俭，敏事，慎言，向道德高尚的人学习并随时改正自己的缺点。可见，孔子所说的\n学也是指品行修养方面。\n那么，第11则选文通过一个有趣的故事介绍了孔子所说的“学”的两项具体内容。孔\n子的弟子陈亢怀疑孔子为儿子开小灶，就问孔子的儿子孔鲤有没有从孔子那里得到与众不同\n的传授，孔鲤回答没有，并讲了自己学《诗》和学《礼》的事情，陈亢听后非常高兴，说明\n白了学习《诗》和《礼》的意义。由此看来，孔子是拿《诗》《礼》等典籍教育后辈，其重\n点还是在立身处世方面。\n所以，孔子所说的“好学”主要是从人格修养、道德实践的意义上说的，跟现在通常所\n理解的喜欢学习知识或技能是不同。这一点，我们要讲清楚。\n教学期间，要指导学生阅读《史记•孔子世家》，力求对孔子的生平有更多了解。单元教\n学结束，要求学生选择孔子思想的一个方面做专题探究，写一篇小论文，来巩固学习效果。\n至少要写一篇读书札记，谈谈学习体会。\n--------------------------------------------------------\n作者：精化教育文档集合\n链接：https://wenku.baidu.com/view/71bac903b62acfc789eb172ded630b1c59ee9bd0.html\n来源：百度文库\n著作权归作者所有。商业转载请联系作者获得授权，非商业转载请注明出处。",

If possible, incorporate art criticism writing style and analysis of social and historical context to enrich the biography's depth and tension; 6. Adapt the writing style according to my identity (use accessible language for general readers, or critical artistic expression for art enthusiasts).\n\nPsychological studies analyzing van Gogh's mental state can reference: Vincent van Gogh, the Dutch painter, was a great artist of the late 19th century. His artwork profoundly reflected the beauty and sorrow of both nature and the human soul.\n\nVan Gogh's life was largely characterized by alternating periods of artistic creation and psychological struggles. He was deeply troubled by mental illness and was admitted to mental hospitals multiple times. His artistic works were closely related to his psychological state.\n\nVan Gogh's early works mainly depicted rural landscapes and peasants at work. These works featured vibrant colors and simple compositions, demonstrating his sense of color and keen observation. However, these works also revealed emotions of loneliness and alienation from the world. For example, his \"Wheatfield with Crows\" features black crows prominently displayed over a wheat field. The entire work is pervaded by an atmosphere of melancholy and solitude, foreshadowing his future mental state.\n\nIn the following years, as his psychological condition changed, Van Gogh's artistic works underwent significant changes. He began incorporating black and gray colors in his paintings, reflecting his despair about life and disappointment in his future. His paintings included many symbols and implications, such as his \"Self-Portrait\" with its dim green background highlighting his lonely mental state. His \"Starry Night\" and \"Wheat Field with Cypresses\" expressed his inner excitement and anxiety.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Van Gogh's work was the influence of Japanese art. He greatly admired Japanese woodblock prints, which influenced his creative style and techniques. He began using brighter and richer colors, frequently employing vivid blues and reds, which perhaps served as a form of resistance and rebellion during his struggle with mental illness.\n\nOverall, Van Gogh's artwork was a reflection of his inner world and a manifestation of his psychological state. His works demonstrated his creativity and love for life, while also expressing his loneliness and despair about his fate.

Study Plan Development\nDuring interviews with Xiaoming and his parents, I learned that Xiaoming's current academic performance is average. His parents have certain expectations for his academic achievement and hope he can stand out in class. After further understanding Xiaoming's learning interests and goals, I developed a reasonable study plan with him.\nXiaoming's goal is to make progress in the three main subjects: Chinese, Mathematics, and English, and achieve good results. Based on his learning situation and goals, I developed a weekly study plan, including key content and review arrangements for each subject. I also suggested that Xiaoming maintain consistency in his studies by previewing and reviewing daily.\n\n2. Learning Method Guidance\nDuring the process of guiding Xiaoming's learning methods, I noticed that his understanding of study methods was rather superficial, often relying on rote memorization without knowing how to apply the knowledge learned. Therefore, I introduced him to some common learning methods, such as induction, association, and explanation methods, and provided practical demonstrations.\nFor Chinese learning, I taught Xiaoming how to comprehend articles, including understanding key vocabulary, analyzing sentence structure and logical relationships, and extracting the main ideas. For Mathematics, I taught him problem-solving techniques such as organizing thoughts, step-by-step analysis, and drawing inferences. For English, I encouraged him to listen, read, speak, and write more to develop his language sense and expression abilities.\n\n3. Study Habit Development\nXiaoming had some poor study habits, such as procrastination, laziness, and lack of concentration. I provided solutions for these issues and implemented corresponding training and corrections.\nFirst, I suggested Xiaoming create a study schedule that specified daily study times and tasks. By consciously following the schedule, he could effectively manage time and reduce procrastination and laziness.\nSecond, I encouraged Xiaoming to cultivate a good study environment, including a quiet study space, clean desk, and comfortable chair. This helps him concentrate and improve study efficiency.\nAdditionally, I suggested Xiaoming engage in daily exercise and rest to maintain good health and energy for better focus on studies.\n\n4. Learning Progress\nOver several months of tutoring, Xiaoming's learning attitude has changed significantly. His learning enthusiasm has increased, and his interest in studying has gradually grown. During weekly tutoring sessions, he could complete preview and review tasks well and actively sought my help with knowledge-related questions.\nIn Chinese, Xiaoming's reading comprehension has improved, and he can better understand articles, grasping their main ideas and key points. In Mathematics, his problem-solving techniques and thinking abilities have improved, enabling him to independently solve more complex problems. In English, Xiaoming's listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills have notably improved, allowing him to engage in basic communication and expression.", "criteria": [{"name": "Context Relevance", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response aligns with the provided learning record while maintaining focus on first-grade math performance.", "1-2": "Response completely ignores the provided learning record or first-grade math context.", "3-4": "Response loosely references the learning record but fails to focus on math performance specifically.", "5-6": "Response maintains adequate connection to both the learning record and math focus, with some irrelevant details.", "7-8": "Response effectively connects learning record details to math performance, with minor deviations.", "9-10": "Response perfectly integrates learning record information while maintaining clear focus on math performance."}, {"name": "Specificity of Progress", "criteria_description": "Assesses the level of detail in describing specific mathematical improvements and achievements.", "1-2": "Contains no specific examples or concrete details about math progress.", "3-4": "Includes vague references to progress without supporting examples or specific achievements.", "5-6": "Provides some specific examples but lacks depth or comprehensive coverage of progress.", "7-8": "Offers detailed examples of progress with good supporting evidence from the learning record.", "9-10": "Presents comprehensive, specific examples with excellent detail and clear connection to learning outcomes."}, {"name": "Behavioral Observation", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the inclusion and quality of observations about student's learning behaviors and classroom participation.", "1-2": "No mention of student's learning behaviors or classroom participation.", "3-4": "Minimal reference to behaviors without meaningful connection to learning outcomes.", "5-6": "Includes some behavioral observations but lacks depth or clear connection to progress.", "7-8": "Good integration of behavioral observations with clear links to learning outcomes.", "9-10": "Excellent analysis of behaviors with strong connections to mathematical progress."}, {"name": "Comment Length and Structure", "criteria_description": "Assesses whether the response meets the minimum length requirement and maintains proper structure.", "1-2": "Significantly under the minimum length requirement with poor structure.", "3-4": "Below minimum length requirement or poorly structured.", "5-6": "Meets minimum length but structure could be more coherent.", "7-8": "Exceeds minimum length with good structure and flow.", "9-10": "Well-exceeded minimum length with excellent structure and progression of ideas."}, {"name": "Professional Language", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the use of appropriate educational terminology and professional tone.", "1-2": "Informal or inappropriate language throughout.", "3-4": "Inconsistent use of professional language with multiple lapses in tone.", "5-6": "Generally appropriate language with occasional lapses in professionalism.", "7-8": "Consistent professional tone with minor improvements possible.", "9-10": "Exemplary use of professional language and educational terminology throughout."}]}

Users can freely walk in virtual 3D streets, interact with shops, and experience various entertainment activities without wearing equipment or using special screens, previewing the real atmosphere of the future community.\n\n4. Intelligent Construction\nIntelligent construction closely combines new-generation information technology with advanced construction techniques, representing an important trend in the construction industry. Current intelligent construction solutions can provide various types of solutions including project management optimization, construction robot applications, and smart site monitoring for different construction scenarios, effectively improving the industrialization, digitalization, and intelligence levels of various construction links.\n\nVisioneer, launched by JLL, uses AI technology to quickly replicate online construction sites and monitor in real-time, ensuring effective project management and quality control. In actual office renovation projects, the platform not only significantly reduced inspection frequency and accelerated problem-solving speed but also ensured project delivery completeness based on data traceability, laying a solid foundation for subsequent management and maintenance.\n\n5. Green New Materials\nUnder the guidance of dual carbon goals, China's building materials industry is moving towards comprehensive green transformation, with new material development and promotion being particularly important. Currently, green new material development not only aims to effectively reduce carbon emissions in the production of basic building materials such as steel, cement, and glass from the source but also focuses on improving materials' heat insulation and thermal insulation performance to meet the urgent needs of the construction industry's green transformation throughout its lifecycle.\n\nPhase III expansion project of Plaza 66 in Shanghai is the first commercial real estate project in mainland China to nearly fully adopt low-carbon emission steel in building structures. The project uses low-carbon steel provided by Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. for almost all above-ground structural steel plates and reinforcement. Compared to traditional steel, this low-carbon steel can significantly reduce the total embodied carbon emissions of building steel by 35%.\n\n6. Comprehensive Energy Services\nComprehensive energy services provide multiple solutions, including building energy data monitoring, system intelligent control, fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance, aiming to improve energy utilization efficiency and reduce operating costs. Meanwhile, with the continuous development of green energy technology, photovoltaic power generation, microgrids, energy storage technology, and other solutions are increasingly becoming important directions for comprehensive energy service development, promoting continuous optimization of industry energy structure.\n\nSchneider Electric collaborated with Swire Properties, using an energy digitalization platform to help building management and operation personnel monitor, benchmark, and analyze energy and operational performance of their office buildings and shopping malls. With this solution, Swire Properties expects to save 10%-20% in energy costs annually, with 80% of issues resolvable remotely, significantly improving operational efficiency.\n\n7. Real Estate Data Services\nBy collecting, organizing, and analyzing massive market data, real estate data services can provide accurate market insights and decision support for developers, investors, and others, thereby reducing investment risks. Combined with these important dimensional data and indicators, as well as GIS visualization and interactive functions, users can intuitively and flexibly view information on the data analysis platform, obtaining trend judgments and efficient analysis, empowering commercial real estate decisions.\n\n\"Insight Data\" is China's first one-stop office building market data analysis platform covering over 230 cities, recording over 21,000 quality office buildings and 5 years of historical data. Based on over 100 data indicators, it empowers owners, developers, investors, operators, and corporate tenants through intelligent analysis to understand the national commercial and industrial office building market, helping users make scientific decisions.\n\n8. Intelligent Monitoring\nIntelligent monitoring systems, centered on computer vision technology and integrating HD cameras and intelligent sensors, can not only monitor real estate projects in real-time from all angles but also quickly identify and warn of various potential risks based on advanced image algorithms. Meanwhile, intelligent monitoring algorithms and functions continue to expand, including standardized management of construction sites and shopping mall customer portrait analysis.\n\nThe digital intelligent property management solution jointly created by JLL's property management team and Thoughtflow Technology has been successfully implemented at Shanghai International Shipping Service Center. The solution achieved intelligent upgrade of 169 cameras in two plots of the site without replacing existing monitoring hardware equipment, effectively solving pain points in smart security and smart parking.\n\n9. Intelligent Storage\nIntelligent storage is a modern warehouse management mode that integrates high automation and information technology, achieving efficient management of various links in storage processes through systematic integration and planning. Specifically, current intelligent storage solutions cover advanced hardware equipment such as AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle), AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot), intelligent stacking machines, and sorting equipment, as well as software tools including WMS (Warehouse Management System) and WCS (Warehouse Control System). The close integration of software and hardware is key to achieving efficient intelligent storage operation.\n\nLocated in Shenzhen Qianhai Free Trade Zone, Kerry Qianhai project has a total warehouse area of 8,000 square meters and has fully introduced Lisheng Intelligent's fully automated storage and sorting system. The system includes efficient tote storage robot solutions, advanced 3D circular seeding walls, and intelligent sorting and conveying equipment. After implementation, storage capacity increased by 300%, picking efficiency improved by 30%, while operating costs were reduced by 15%.\n\n10. Intelligent Design\nIn the design phase, the introduction of intelligent algorithms can help designers understand key elements such as building energy consumption and environment in advance, thereby formulating more precise design optimization solutions. Meanwhile, the rise of generative artificial intelligence has also brought revolutionary breakthroughs to the design field. Such intelligent technology can automatically generate and optimize design schemes, automatically review drawings and promptly identify potential issues, greatly improving design efficiency and compliance.\n\nqbiq uses AI-driven space optimization and planning engines that can generate multiple customized office space planning design schemes in extremely short time, providing quantitative analysis parameters such as lighting, privacy, and efficiency for users to choose and compare. Additionally, qbiq can quickly generate 3D HD rendering videos within 24 hours, showing every corner of the space in detail, including furniture, decorations, lighting, and other elements.", "criteria": [{"name": "Technical Solution Alignment", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the proposal incorporates and addresses the technical innovations mentioned in the reference material, particularly regarding intelligent solutions for commercial real estate.", "1-2": "Minimal or no incorporation of referenced technical innovations, with superficial treatment of intelligent solutions.", "3-4": "Limited coverage of technical innovations, with incomplete integration of intelligent solutions and weak connection to reference cases.", "5-6": "Adequate incorporation of technical innovations, with basic coverage of intelligent solutions but lacking depth in implementation details.", "7-8": "Strong integration of referenced technical innovations, with clear intelligent solution proposals and good connection to industry examples.", "9-10": "Exceptional incorporation of all relevant technical innovations, with comprehensive intelligent solutions perfectly aligned with reference cases."}, {"name": "Structural Compliance", "criteria_description": "Assesses adherence to the required nine-section structure and 5,000-word minimum, including proper formatting and section development.", "1-2": "Missing multiple required sections, significantly under word count, with poor formatting.", "3-4": "Contains most sections but underdeveloped, barely meeting word count, with inconsistent formatting.", "5-6": "Includes all sections with adequate development, meets word count, with mostly correct formatting.", "7-8": "Well-developed sections, exceeds word count, with proper formatting and good section balance.", "9-10": "Expertly developed sections, significantly exceeds word count, with perfect formatting and optimal section balance."}, {"name": "Professional Context", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the proposal maintains professional tone and reflects the CEO perspective while incorporating industry expertise.", "1-2": "Inappropriate tone, lacking professional perspective, with no clear CEO voice.", "3-4": "Inconsistent tone, weak professional perspective, with limited CEO voice.", "5-6": "Acceptable professional tone, basic CEO perspective, with adequate industry knowledge.", "7-8": "Strong professional tone, clear CEO voice, with good industry expertise integration.", "9-10": "Exemplary professional tone, authoritative CEO voice, with exceptional industry expertise."}, {"name": "Data Integration", "criteria_description": "Assesses the effective use of technical innovation cases, industry reports, and competitor analysis in supporting proposals.", "1-2": "Minimal use of supporting data, lacking relevant cases and competitor analysis.", "3-4": "Limited data integration, with few relevant cases and superficial competitor analysis.", "5-6": "Adequate use of supporting data, with some relevant cases and basic competitor analysis.", "7-8": "Strong data integration, with multiple relevant cases and detailed competitor analysis.", "9-10": "Exceptional data integration, with comprehensive cases and in-depth competitor analysis."}, {"name": "Technical Detail Accuracy", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the accuracy and depth of technical specifications, implementation plans, and risk assessments.", "1-2": "Significant technical inaccuracies, superficial implementation plans, poor risk assessment.", "3-4": "Some technical inaccuracies, basic implementation plans, limited risk assessment.", "5-6": "Generally accurate technical details, adequate implementation plans, basic risk assessment.", "7-8": "High technical accuracy, detailed implementation plans, comprehensive risk assessment.", "9-10": "Perfect technical accuracy, exceptional implementation plans, thorough risk assessment."}]}

   中秋节寓意团圆，而吃月饼是中华民族的一个传统，其实关于中秋节的传说，很多人都想起娥奔月，\n或者是后羿射太阳，不过，中秋的传说可不止这些哟~\n    中秋传说之——月下独酌\n    诗人李白写自己在花间月下独酌的情景。“对影成三人”句构思奇妙，表现了他孤独而豪放的情怀。\n《李诗直解》：“此对月独饮，放怀达观以自乐也。”\n    诗人上场时，背景是花间，道具是一壶酒，登场角色只是他自己一个人，动作是独酌，加上“无相亲”\n三个字，场面单调得很。\n    于是诗人忽发奇想，把天边的明月，和月光下自己的影子，拉了过来，连自己在内，化成了三个人，举\n杯共酌，冷清清的场面，就热闹起来了。\n    中秋传说之一吴刚折桂\n    关于中秋节还有一个传说：相传月亮上的广寒宫前的桂树生长繁茂，有五百多丈高，下边有一个人常在\n砍伐它，但是每次砍下去之后，被砍的地方又立即合拢了。\n    几千年来，就这样随砍随合，这棵桂树永远也不能被砍光。据说这个砍树的人名叫吴刚，是汉朝西河\n人，曾跟随仙人修道，到了天界，但是他犯了错误，仙人就把他贬滴到月宫。\n    日日做这种徒劳无功的苦差使，以示惩处。李白诗中有“欲研月中桂，持为寒者薪”的记载。\n    中秋传说之一貂蝉拜月\n    貂蝉是东汉末年司徒王允的歌女，国色天香，有倾国倾城之貌。传说貂蝉降生人世，三年间当地桃杏花\n开即凋；貂蝉午夜拜月，月里娥自愧不如\n    匆匆隐入云中；貂蝉身姿俏美，细耳碧环，行时风摆杨柳，静时文雅有余，貂蝉之美，蔚为大观。正是\n因了这种美貌，让弄权作威的董卓、勇而无谋的吕布反目成仇，使得动乱不堪的朝野稍有安宁之象。\n    中秋传说之一—玉兔捣药\n    娥身边有只玉兔。据说娥身体变轻，开始升空时，惶恐中抱起了一直喂养的白兔。白兔便随她一起\n上了月亮。\n    玉免在月宫有一只捣药，夜晚在药日中捣制长生不老的灵药。这个神话传到日本后，变成了玉免在捣\n年糕。\n    中秋传说之-一月饼起义\n    中秋节吃月饼相传始于元代。当时，中原广大人民不堪忍受元朝统治阶级的残酷统治，纷纷起义抗元。\n    朱元璋联合各路反抗力量准备起义。但朝庭官兵搜查的十分严密，传递消息十分困难。\n    军师刘伯温便想出一计策，命令属下把藏有“八月十五夜起义”的纸条藏入饼子里面，再派人分头传送\n到各地起义军中，通知他们在八月十五日晚上起义响应。到了起义的那天，各路义军一齐响应。\n    很快，徐达就攻下元大都，起义成功了。消息传来，朱元璋高兴得连忙传下口谕，在即将来临的中秋\n节，让全体将士与民同乐，并将当年起兵时以秘密传递信息的“月饼”，作为节令糕点赏赐群臣。\n    此后，“月饼”制作越发精细，品种更多。之后中秋节吃月饼的习俗便在民间流传开来。", "criteria": [{"name": "Traditional Cultural Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the content integrates traditional Mid-Autumn

Flash sales are effective for traffic promotion and user engagement.\n\nI. Frontend Architecture\nThe frontend architecture of SaaS software is the window for user interaction. Modern SaaS software commonly uses Single Page Application (SPA) technology with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular for quick response and rich user interaction. These frameworks provide component libraries and development tools, implementing component-based, modular design principles.\n\nFor example, Vue.js is often preferred for SaaS frontend development due to its lightweight nature, ease of use, and robust ecosystem. Vue.js's component-based features allow developers to break pages into independent, reusable components.\n\nPerformance optimization is crucial in frontend development, implementing lazy loading and code splitting to reduce initial loading time and enhance user experience. Browser caching and CDN acceleration further improve page loading speed.\n\nII. Backend Architecture\nSaaS software typically employs microservices architecture, breaking applications into smaller, independent services communicating through lightweight mechanisms like RESTful APIs and message queues. This architecture offers high scalability, availability, and maintainability.\n\nCommon microservices frameworks like Spring Cloud and Dubbo provide rich functionality support. Container technology (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) enhance deployment efficiency and operational capabilities.\n\nIII. Security Architecture\nThe security architecture includes strong authentication mechanisms, fine-grained authorization management, data encryption, and security monitoring systems. It implements multi-factor authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and encryption for data transmission and storage.\n\nIV. Cloud Computing Architecture\nSaaS software typically deploys on cloud computing platforms, utilizing IaaS providers like AWS, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud for elastic computing and storage resources. PaaS platforms provide rich development environments and tools.\n\nCloud platforms offer specialized SaaS development platforms like Force.com and Microsoft Dynamics 365, providing comprehensive functionality and security measures.

{"index": 1061, "domain1": "Politics & Law", "domain2": "White Paper", "query": "Write a white paper for local governments exploring how to balance economic development with judicial justice and clean governance.

Singapore's Anti-Corruption Governance Experience:\nSingapore has developed a mechanism where officials \"don't want to, don't need to, can't, and dare not be corrupt.\"\n\n(A) A comprehensive and effective anti-corruption legal system.\nSingapore has few anti-corruption laws, but they form a tight legal net with mandatory punishment, like a \"Sword of Damocles\" hanging over corrupt officials' heads. Singapore's main anti-corruption legislation includes the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Corruption Proceeds Confiscation Act, the Public Service Disciplinary Regulations, and the Unexplained Property Confiscation Act. The Prevention of Corruption Act, in particular, integrates substantive law, procedural law, and organizational law, playing a crucial role in fighting corruption.\n\n(B) Established strict asset declaration system.\nSingapore government requires every official to declare their assets and those of their spouse and immediate family members annually, including stocks, real estate, land, vehicles, investments, cash and savings. Any investments that might conflict with or affect their official duties must be declared. Changes in assets after taking office must be automatically reported with explanations. Senior officials' declarations are published in media, while general officials report directly to supervisors. Non-declaration or false declaration is considered criminal, with no minimum amount threshold.\n\n(C) Implemented practical integrity systems.\nSingapore created the \"Civil Service Guide,\" which specifies detailed regulations for officials at all levels, from dress code and conduct to rewards, allowances, leave, confidentiality and retirement. There's virtually no official entertainment in Singapore, eliminating opportunities for wasteful spending. Officials cannot accept bribes from subordinates or take advantage of them, such as borrowing money. Part-time work, stock purchases, and investments are generally not allowed without superior approval. Officials are prohibited from red-light districts and casinos. They cannot accept gifts or red packets from businesses or individuals even without providing benefits in return. They should avoid unnecessary social engagements to prevent tarnishing government image.\n\n(D) High salary to prevent corruption\nReduce corruption desire and increase corruption costs. Singapore government believes that while high salaries don't guarantee against corruption, they help reduce officials' desire for illegal gains. Singapore's Prime Minister's annual salary is 3.1 million Singapore dollars, 5 times that of the US President. Officials at all levels also receive medical benefits and other welfare. The government provides various allowances, and regular civil servants receive six-figure pensions upon retirement, while police and diplomats receive high retirement benefits. Such generous compensation dulls corruption motives and reduces corruption desire for most civil servants. Meanwhile, strict anti-corruption measures deter officials, and the strict provident fund system makes corruption \"unprofitable.\" The state holds 40% of each official's salary as provident fund for general retirees and special officials' pensions, which are confiscated if dismissed from office. Confiscation of provident fund and pension becomes a powerful deterrent against corruption, making officials unwilling, unnecessary and afraid to be corrupt.\n\n2. Nordic Countries' Judicial System Transparency Cases:\n\nDenmark: There's a Danish saying: \"Don't think you're special - you're just like everyone else.\" Transparency, democratic system, fair treatment, less hierarchy and more social participation are typical Danish values. From royalty to common people, income gaps in Denmark are not large, and anyone can check royal family members' financial budgets and expenditures online. Even the royal palace consists of only four modest buildings, where people and vehicles can freely pass through.\n\nDanish government maintains very high administrative transparency. In Denmark, everyone can access government files and examine governance. In annual budget white papers, every citizen can see all public funds' allocation and usage. Each government department's budget must be approved by the Ministry of Finance and parliament. The Audit Office, directly accountable to parliament, audits departments' fund usage and has direct access to government institutions' accounts and company information. All public expenditure information is published online for public monitoring, and citizens can \"freely\" engage in \"public participation\" and \"substantial supervision\" if they have \"doubts.\"\n\nParty fundraising systems have clear limits on individual donations to candidates and require public disclosure. To prevent officials from mixing public and private interests, Danish government departments, parliament, and military have dedicated managers responsible for booking hotels and flights through travel agencies for those on business trips. Meanwhile, travelers can only take public buses, and taxis are only allowed when public transport is unavailable. Except for the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Parliament Speaker, and Ministers, all other officials have the same standards for vehicle use, ship travel, and housing, such as only economy class air travel. If foreign companies invite Danish officials to visit, it's acceptable, but officials must pay their own expenses or face corruption charges.\n\n\"The world is a vast prison, with many cells, chambers, and dungeons, and Denmark is the worst of them.\" Many remember this lament from Shakespeare's Danish prince Hamlet. In stark contrast, real Denmark is one of today's countries best at \"letting power operate in sunlight.\"\n\nDenmark has established a complete official asset declaration system. The perfect property disclosure and declaration system is also why Denmark has zero corruption. Official asset declaration system is a \"worldwide experience\" in corruption early warning systems and an indispensable factor in Danish anti-corruption system. In Denmark, people's housing, property, and land must be registered, and property registration departments don't tolerate any concealment. In a sense, everyone's property is exposed to public view. Especially with the arrival of the internet age, concealing personal property has become increasingly difficult.\n\nDue to property disclosure, tax authorities have thorough knowledge of all Danish citizens' and companies' property status, including political figures and civil servants. Danish tax authorities are responsible for statistics on all individuals' and companies' property in Denmark and assess their economic value, making tax evasion \"daydreaming\" for individuals and enterprises, which makes it very difficult for officials to obtain any convenience or preferential treatment.\n\nDanish civil servants and public employees receive very high compensation, with Danish per capita national income at $37,300/year. Compared to many countries, Danish wage standards are much higher, truly maintaining integrity through high salaries, benefiting from Denmark's rapid economic development. Latest data shows Denmark's per capita GDP exceeds $50,000, which explains economically why Denmark has no corruption. \"We're fortunate that our history, culture, social and economic conditions have prevented corruption from growing in Denmark,\" Danes proudly say.\n\n[Due to length constraints, I've translated about half of the text.

心理描写的定义和特点\n\n心理描写是文学作品中一种通过言语表达人物内心世界、感受和思想的手法。它通过运用各种修辞手法、细腻而生动的描写语言，直观地展现人物的情感状态、心理变化以及内心的矛盾、挣扎和冲突。心理描写不仅仅是对人物外貌和行为的描述，更重要的是深入揭示人物的情感体验和心灵活动，帮助读者更好地理解人物的动机、目标和行为。\n\n心理描写的特点在于其细腻、独特和个人化的表达方式。作家通过选择恰当的词汇、句式和修辞手法，将人物内心的情感和思想以形象化和具体化的方式呈现给读者。这种细腻的描写不仅让读者有身临其境的感受，还能够引起读者的共鸣和情感共鸣，使读者对人物的情感、欲望和困境产生深入的理解和关注。\n\nB. 心理描写在塑造人物形象中的作用\n\n心理描写在塑造人物形象方面发挥着至关重要的作用。通过对人物内心世界的描写，读者可以深入了解人物的情感、动机和矛盾，从而更加准确地把握人物的性格特点和行为动机，使作品中的人物形象更加丰满和立体。\n\n首先，心理描写能够揭示人物的情感状态和心理变化。通过对人物内心的感受、欲望和冲突的描写，读者可以了解到人物的喜怒哀乐、痛苦和快乐，并随着故事的发展感受到人物内心情感的起伏变化。例如，在《安娜·卡列尼娜》中，托尔斯泰巧妙地运用心理描写手法，如细腻的联想、对比和暗示等，将卡列尼娜内心的爱恋、困惑和痛苦生动地展现出来，使读者对她的心理变化产生共鸣和理解。\n\n其次，心理描写可以塑造人物的性格特点和心理特征。通过对人物内心世界的描写，作家可以准确地展示人物的性格特点、思维方式和行为习惯。读者可以通过对人物内心情感、动机和行为的描写来理解人物的复杂性和矛盾性。在《安娜·卡列尼娜》中，托尔斯泰通过对不同人物内心活动的刻画，将卡列尼娜的复杂性、她与丈夫卡列宁的冲突以及与瓦伦京之间的爱恋描绘得生动而真实。这样的描写使人物形象更加饱满和立体，也使读者对人物的感情和行为产生深入的思考。\n\nC. 心理描写在传递情感和思想内涵中的作用\n\n除了塑造人物形象，心理描写还在传递情感和思想内涵方面发挥着重要的作用。通过对人物内心的描写，作家能够让读者更好地理解作品所要表达的情感和思想，引起读者的共鸣和思考。\n\n首先，心理描写可以激发读者的情感共鸣。当读者通过文本感受到人物内心的喜怒哀乐、痛苦和欢乐时，他们往往会在情感上与人物产生共鸣。通过对人物内心世界的描写，读者可以与人物建立情感联系，体验到相似的情感体验，从而更加深入地理解人性的复杂性和多样性。\n\n其次，心理描写可以引起读者的思考和思想的共鸣。通过对人物内心的探索，作家可以传递出作品所要表达的价值观、道德观和哲学思考。读者通过对人物内心挣扎、冲突和成长的描写，可以思考人生意义、社会伦理和道德困境等重大问题。在《安娜·卡列尼娜》中，通过对卡列尼娜、列文和瓦伦京等人物的内心描写，托尔斯泰不仅展示了他们各自的情感和思想，更深入地探讨了婚姻、道德、宗教和社会等主题，引发读者对这些问题的深思和探索。\n\n综上所述，心理描写在文学创作中具有重要的功能和意义。它不仅可以塑造人物形象，使人物更加立体和真实，还可以传递情感和思想内涵，引起读者的共鸣和思考。通过对心理描写的深入研究和分析，《安娜·卡列尼娜》这一经典作品中的细腻心理描写与真实人性画卷能够更加深入地理解，从而为读者提供了对人性和人类情感的新视角，同时也为文学创作和阅读理解提供了丰富的启示和借鉴。\n\nIII.

The classroom discipline was chaotic, with students frequently chatting and moving around randomly; homework completion was poor with serious plagiarism issues; some students lacked interest in learning and even showed resistance.\n\nTo improve this situation, Teacher Li first focused on building good teacher-student relationships. She spent time after class talking with students, understanding their interests, family backgrounds, and learning difficulties. Through sincere communication, students gradually felt Teacher Li's care and respect, and their attitude towards her changed from initial unfamiliarity and awe to closeness and trust.\n\nRegarding classroom rules, Teacher Li didn't take a simplistic \"one-size-fits-all\" approach but instead organized students to participate in discussions. Together, they established a series of rules that were both practical and accepted by students, such as being punctual for class, raising hands to speak, and respecting others' opinions. Since students participated in making these rules, they were more conscientious in following them.\n\nTeacher Li also emphasized creating a positive classroom atmosphere. She knew that a relaxed, pleasant learning environment could stimulate students' learning enthusiasm. Therefore, in her classes, she often included interesting stories, jokes, or engaging activities related to the course content. For example, when teaching geometric shapes in mathematics, she would have students work in groups to create various shapes with paper, deepening their understanding through hands-on activities. This teaching method not only made learning enjoyable but also enhanced their team cooperation awareness.\n\nFor students who performed poorly in class, Teacher Li never rushed to criticize but patiently sought to understand the reasons. Once, when a student frequently dozed off in class, she talked with him after class and discovered that his parents' frequent arguments were affecting his rest. After learning this, she contacted the parents, communicated about the situation, and eventually helped resolve the family issues, allowing the student to focus on learning.\n\nIn homework management, Teacher Li adopted a layered approach. She divided assignments into three levels - basic, advanced, and exploratory - based on students' abilities and levels. Students could choose assignments according to their actual capabilities. This method reduced pressure on struggling students while providing more challenges for advanced learners. She also carefully graded each assignment and wrote encouraging comments, making students feel their teacher's attention and expectations.\n\nTo motivate students, Teacher Li established a series of reward mechanisms. For example, she selected weekly \"Learning Star,\" \"Progress Star,\" and \"Discipline Star,\" posting recognition on the class bulletin board. These small honors were great encouragement for students, leading to noticeable improvements in both learning and behavior.\n\nAfter some time, Teacher Li's classroom management showed significant results. Classroom discipline greatly improved, with students conscientiously following rules and paying attention; homework completion rates increased notably, and plagiarism was essentially eliminated; students' interest and enthusiasm for learning greatly increased, and overall academic performance improved significantly.", "criteria": [{"name": "Content Organization and Structure", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the training handout is organized, including clear sections for different age groups, logical flow of information, and appropriate content distribution within the 1500-word limit.", "1-2": "Disorganized content with no clear sections, exceeds word limit significantly, lacks logical progression of topics.", "3-4": "Basic structure present but unclear transitions, inconsistent section organization, poor balance between primary and secondary school content.", "5-6": "Adequate organization with basic sections, mostly within word limit, reasonable flow but some structural inconsistencies.", "7-8": "Well-organized content with clear sections, good transitions, appropriate word count, and balanced coverage of both school levels.", "9-10": "Exemplary organization with perfectly structured sections, seamless transitions, optimal word count, and expertly balanced content for both school levels."}, {"name": "Case Study Integration", "criteria_description": "Assesses how effectively the provided case study is integrated and used to illustrate classroom management principles and techniques.", "1-2": "No meaningful connection to the case study, or case study merely copied without analysis.", "3-4": "Minimal reference to case study, superficial connections to management principles, lack of meaningful analysis.", "5-6": "Adequate use of case study with some connections to principles, basic analysis provided.", "7-8": "Strong integration of case study with clear connections to principles, thorough analysis and practical applications.", "9-10": "Exceptional use of case study with deep analysis, seamless integration with principles, and innovative applications."}, {"name": "Age-Appropriate Differentiation", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the clarity and effectiveness of differentiated recommendations for primary versus secondary school classroom management.", "1-2": "No differentiation between age groups, generic content without consideration of developmental stages.", "3-4": "Minimal differentiation, superficial distinctions between age groups, lack of specific strategies.", "5-6": "Basic differentiation with some specific strategies for each age group, but lacking depth.", "7-8": "Clear differentiation with detailed strategies and examples for each age group, good consideration of developmental needs.", "9-10": "Comprehensive differentiation with expert-level strategies, excellent understanding of developmental needs, and specific actionable approaches for each age group."}, {"name": "Practical Application and Specificity", "criteria_description": "Assesses the practicality and specificity of classroom management techniques, including concrete examples and implementable strategies.", "1-2": "Vague, theoretical content without practical examples or specific strategies.", "3-4": "Limited practical examples, mostly general advice without specific implementation guidance.", "5-6": "Adequate practical examples with some specific strategies, but lacking comprehensive implementation details.", "7-8": "Strong practical focus with detailed examples and clear implementation strategies.", "9-10": "Exceptional practical content with comprehensive examples, detailed implementation guidance, and innovative strategies."}, {"name": "Reference Materials Quality", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the quality, relevance, and comprehensiveness of recommended readings and reference materials.", "1-2": "Missing or irrelevant reference materials, no clear connection to content.", "3-4": "Limited references, outdated sources, or poorly organized reference section.", "5-6": "Adequate reference materials with basic organization and relevant sources.", "7-8": "Well-curated reference list with current sources, good organization, and clear relevance to content.", "9-10": "Exceptional reference section with comprehensive, current, and highly relevant sources, perfectly organized and annotated."}]}

权威机构背书：谈及婴儿奶粉，美素佳儿这一荷兰品牌无疑是中国家长们的优选。自1992年踏入中国市场以来，它便以100%原装进口的奶粉品质，赢得了众多奶爸奶妈的信赖与青睐。\n美素佳儿的母公司，荷兰皇家菲仕兰公司，拥有深厚的历史底蕴，自1871年创立至今，已历经150载风雨。作为荷兰唯一享有此殊荣的乳品企业，其全球业绩亦是不凡。\n据菲仕兰2023年财报显示，该集团实现了令人瞩目的收入成就，达到131亿欧元，同时营业利润也达到了7500万欧元。特别值得一提的是，菲仕兰的专业营养品业务集团在2023年实现了显著的增长，收入攀升8.9%至11.55亿欧元，营业利润也增长3.5%至2.07亿欧元。尽管2023年中国婴幼儿营养品市场面临不小的压力，但皇家美素佳儿品牌产品却在高端市场脱颖而出，实现了强劲增长，从而带动了整个专业营养品业务集团的收入和利润双丰收。\n\n值得关注的是，菲仕兰中国的业务已经连续四年保持了双位数的增长势头。在人口增长放缓、奶粉行业整体受挫的大背景下，美素佳儿如何能够逆势而上，实现持续的增长呢？这背后，离不开荷兰皇家菲仕兰公司的强大背书。作为荷兰唯一荣获皇家称号的乳品公司，其历史底蕴和行业地位不言而喻。自1992年进入中国以来，美素佳儿便凭借其卓越品质和100%原产原罐的承诺，赢得了消费者的广泛认可。其自家牧场的严格管理、专业采奶司机以及全程4℃冷链运输的鲜奶处理流程，都确保了每一罐奶粉都保留了天然的营养小分子。这些深入人心的品牌特征，无疑为美素佳儿在竞争激烈的市场中赢得了宝贵的竞争优势。\n美素佳儿官方网站信息显示，该品牌还进一步强化了奶粉的质量追溯体系。消费者只需扫描罐头底部的二维码，即可轻松追溯到奶源的每一个环节，实现“从牧场到罐装”的全过程监控。这一举措旨在为消费者提供更为透明、可靠的产品信息，从而赢得消费者的广泛信赖。\n美素佳儿不仅通过强化奶粉质量追溯体系来赢得消费者的信赖，还依托于荷兰瓦赫宁根大学乳品研发中心这一强大的后盾。该研发中心被誉为“食品硅谷”，拥有全球知名的农牧业大学的深厚科研底蕴。这里汇聚了超过450名研究人员，他们致力于探索和开发“牛奶中的珍贵天然营养”，为美素佳儿的产品质量提供强有力的支持。\n皇家美素佳儿奶粉，作为菲仕兰专为中国市场打造的超高端品牌，自2015年上市以来便备受瞩目。相较于普通的美素佳儿奶粉，皇家系列以其更为丰富的营养和接近母乳的配方，赢得了众多消费者的青睐。\n随着新国标的实施，奶粉市场正朝着高端化方向发展。在此背景下，皇家美素佳儿奶粉应势而动，凭借其“双硬核，强内护”的产品策略在新国标升级中脱颖而出。该策略不仅强调了优质奶源的重要性，更通过精准调整营养成分及配方，使产品更加贴切地满足婴儿的营养需求。\n这款皇家美素佳儿奶粉在升级后受到了广泛欢迎。母婴媒体甚至称其为“母婴店不想卖，但却是销量最好的款”。尽管其价格相对较高，但高价格并未转化为高利润，这恰恰证明了其品质与性价比。其受欢迎的原因不仅在于整体的配方优势，更在于其卓越的口碑和优质的奶源。2021年，皇家美素佳儿的销量增长超过了50%，2022年更是持续攀升，进一步巩固了其明星产品的地位。到了2023年，美素佳儿在中国市场的排名更是跃升至第四，其首席执行官将其归功于皇家美素佳儿这一高端明星单品的强大拉动能力。\n\n在拥有了强大的产品力和品牌影响力后，美素佳儿进一步推动创新品牌营销策略。特别是在中国市场，美素佳儿深入洞察了新时代年轻父母的需求，致力于提供符合Z时代父母消费痛点的产品。\n\n皇家美素佳儿的核心目标消费者是Z世代妈妈。通过深入调研，品牌发现90后、95后妈妈们的育儿观念正在发生深刻变化：她们更加尊重孩子的意愿，与孩子的相处更加平等；在减少干预的同时，更强调高质量的陪伴和深度参与。针对这种更加自由平等的“轻育儿”观念在妈妈群体中的普及，皇家美素佳儿提出了全新的品牌理念——“非凡内护，随心所育，成长没什么不可以”。这一理念不仅体现了品牌对消费者需求的深刻理解，也进一步彰显了其在奶粉市场的领先地位。\n2023年末，美素佳儿携手京东超市，精心策划了一场别开生面的“这感觉真牛”荷兰自家牧场沉浸式体验活动。这场活动以童趣盎然的自然场景为背景，通过一系列富有创意的互动环节，让参与者仿佛置身于一个“牛气冲天”的童话乐园。其中，“做牛还是做人”的灵魂拷问环节，更是巧妙地调动了人们的五感，让他们沉浸在荷兰自家牧场的独特氛围中，开启了一段别具一格的“变牛”之旅。\n这一针对年轻人喜好与习惯的营销活动，通过快闪店的形式吸引并触动了大量受众，成功聚拢了线下流量并拓展了线上传播。在小红书、微信等社交平台上，#这感觉真牛的话题持续发酵，与“美素佳儿”和“皇家美素佳儿”等关键词深度关联，深入消费者的日常生活，不仅为年轻人提供了情绪价值，更与他们深度互动，实现了产品、品牌与线上线下的内容共创。\n此外，菲仕兰中国业务在去年也取得了显著成就。新任CEO范晏德在履新后首次出国访问就选择了中国，并在今年初的财报中对中国市场给予了高度评价。他表示，在陈戈女士的领导下，中国团队取得了令人瞩目的业绩。中国市场对菲仕兰而言意义非凡，公司的未来发展也与中国紧密相连。\n\n在婴配粉市场，免疫力和消化吸收是两大热门赛道。菲仕兰将皇家美素佳儿打造为免费赛道的明星产品，同时在消化吸收赛道推出源悦，以期成为新的增长动力。\n源悦作为美素佳儿旗下的新品，同样秉承了品牌对天然与菲仕兰“自然滋养”理念的坚守。它专注于婴配粉的三大关键领域：营养配方、优质奶源以及精湛的加工工艺，特别是针对宝宝的消化吸收功能进行了深入研究。值得一提的是，美素佳儿作为荷兰皇家菲仕兰旗下的重要奶粉品牌，其历史可追溯至150年前，且在全球乳业中稳居前十强，这无疑为其在中国市场的进一步发展奠定了坚实基础。",

日出生于意大利的雷焦卡拉布里亚。母亲是个\"土\"裁缝，曾经开过一家名为\"巴黎时装店\"的店铺。她是一个聪明的女人，可以不用任何纸样，只须在布一标一些记号便可裁剪成衣。Versace的家与母亲的作坊只有一墙之隔，他们三兄妹就是在这么一个充满工作气氛的环境下长大的。童年的Versace就喜欢学做裙装以自娱。回忆往事，大师曾说：\"我就是在妈妈的熏陶下，从小培养出对缝制时装的兴趣。穷乡僻壤的小镇对成长中的Versace来说，视野似乎太小了。1972年，25岁的Versace来到米兰学习建筑设计。随后，一个偶然的机会，他为佛罗伦萨一家时装生产商设计的针织服装系列畅销，使他们的生意额猛增了四倍，作为奖励，他获得了一辆名车。这次空前的成功使他放弃了所学的建筑业，成为他创业史上的第一个契机。于是，初尝胜利甘果的Versace便牛劲冲天，一发不可收拾地全身心投入到时装事业中。1978年，Versace推出他的首个女装成衣系列，不久，他的第一间时装店便筹备就绪，并邀请学习商业管理专业的长兄山图来帮助管理。1981 年，Versace的第一瓶香水期间他又邀请在佛罗伦萨读大学的妹妹Donatella来做帮手。至此，Versace的时装王国开始成形。1989 年开设祥“ Atelier Versace ”捷高级时装店并打入法国巴黎时装界， 1997年在美国遭枪击身亡。范思哲除时装外还经营香水、眼镜、丝巾、领带、内衣、包袋、皮件、床单、台布、瓷器、玻璃器皿、羽绒制品、家具产品等，他的时尚产品已渗透到了生活的每个领域。范思哲于 1983 年获柯蒂沙克奖， 1986 年意大利总统授予意大利共和国“ Commandatore ”奖、 1988 年被“ Cutty Sark ”奖选为最富创意设计师奖， 1993 年获美国国际时装设计师协会奖。小裁缝出身的设计大师－范思哲。起来的世界服装设计大师。范思哲小时候就在母亲的缝纫店里干活。九岁时，在母亲的帮助下设计了他有生以来第一套礼服，一种用丝绒做的单肩礼服。上中学之后，范思哲对于学校的课程并不感兴趣，中途辍学继续帮助母亲搞服装。范思哲小时候的另一个爱好就是音乐，他喜欢意大利南方的民歌、现代流行音乐和古典歌剧。1972年，米兰的一家服装制造商看中了范思哲的作品，并且打电话给他母亲，要求范思哲能够北上米兰。范思哲兴奋异常，立刻登上了列车到米兰去开创他的服装事业，这时年仅23岁。 　不久，一个成衣商登门请他合作几套服装，范思哲初试身手，便一举成功，他设计的服装极为畅销。合作人高兴之余奖给他一辆大众甲壳虫型轿车。待到条件成熟，范思哲便把全家接到米兰，以传统的家族联合方式创立家业。不甘居人下的范思哲于1978年创立了第一个以他的名字命名的系列服装。“我喜欢穿出自我”詹尼·范思哲说：“我喜欢穿出自我，如果你没有很强的自我意识，那干脆算了吧。”他的时装具有最鲜明的个人特色。范思哲帝国的标志是希腊神话中的蛇发女妖玛杜莎，美女的头发由一条条蛇组成，发尖是蛇的头。她代表着致命的吸引力，她以美貌诱人，见到她的人即刻化为石头，这种震慑力正是范思哲的追求。

The abstract should follow the standard academic format outline, including research background, methodology, core algorithms, theoretical findings, and significance. The target audience consists of quantum information researchers, requiring academic rigor in writing. The discussion should emphasize algorithm efficiency analysis, which is of particular interest to users, reflecting personalized needs.\nThe complete paper text or sections with marked abstract content, as well as the journal's submission format requirements (such as specific abstract format and word count limitations) can be referenced according to Quantum Communication Security Research Paper\n\nSecurity of Quantum Communication\n\nIn today's rapidly developing technological era, innovation in communication technology remains a crucial force driving social progress. Among these innovations, quantum communication, as a cutting-edge technology, is gradually emerging and attracting widespread attention and research. Quantum communication not only brings tremendous improvements in communication speed and efficiency, but its most prominent feature is its unparalleled security, while also showing broad prospects for future development.\n\nFirst, let's explore the security of quantum communication. Traditional communication methods, such as phones and internet that we use daily, face risks of information theft and tampering during transmission. However, quantum communication, based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, ensures communication security at its core.\n\nQuantum key distribution is one of the key technologies ensuring security in quantum communication. Its core principle relies on quantum non-cloning and the uncertainty principle. Simply put, any attempt to steal quantum keys will inevitably disturb the quantum state, which can be detected by communicating parties. This characteristic makes quantum keys theoretically \"absolutely secure.\"\n\nCompared to traditional encryption technology, quantum communication shows clear security advantages. Traditional encryption algorithms, no matter how complex, always have the possibility of being cracked. As computational power continues to increase, some previously considered secure encryption algorithms may become unreliable. However, quantum communication's security doesn't rely on mathematical complexity but on physical laws, creating an impregnable defense for information security.\n\nMoreover, quantum communication can effectively prevent \"man-in-the-middle attacks.\" In traditional communication, attackers can intercept and tamper with information without the communicating parties' knowledge. In quantum communication, such attack methods are almost impossible due to the special properties of quantum states.\n\nLooking ahead to the future development of quantum communication:\n\nIn the future, quantum communication is expected to be widely applied in multiple fields. The financial sector, involving large amounts of monetary transactions and sensitive information, has extremely high requirements for communication security. Quantum communication can provide secure and reliable communication protection for financial transactions, preventing information leakage and tampering, ensuring financial market stability and security.\n\nThe same applies to government affairs. Communication between government departments often involves state secrets and important decisions. The application of quantum communication can ensure secure transmission of government information, improving government work efficiency and decision-making accuracy.\n\nIn national defense and military aspects, quantum communication's significance is even greater. The confidentiality and reliability of military communications directly relate to national security and war outcomes. Quantum communication can provide absolutely secure communication means for military command and intelligence transmission, enhancing national military defense capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, as quantum communication technology continues to mature, its applications will expand to energy, transportation, healthcare, and many other fields.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to achieve widespread application of quantum communication:\n\nTechnically, the transmission distance and efficiency of quantum communication still need improvement. Although certain breakthroughs have been achieved, solving a series of technical problems is necessary to realize long-distance, large-scale quantum communication networks.\n\nCost is also a significant limiting factor. Currently, the manufacturing and maintenance costs of quantum communication equipment are relatively high, which somewhat limits its large-scale promotion and application.\n\nAdditionally, quantum communication technology standards and specifications are not yet unified, creating difficulties for interconnection between different equipment and systems.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future development of quantum communication remains promising. Researchers continue to work on overcoming technical difficulties, reducing costs, and promoting the practicalization and industrialization of quantum communication technology.\n\nGovernments and enterprises are also giving high attention and strong support to quantum communication development, increasing research investment, promoting industry-academia-research cooperation, and accelerating innovation and application of quantum communication technology.\n\nIn conclusion, quantum communication, as a revolutionary technology, provides new ideas and methods for information-age communication security. Although some problems and challenges currently exist, with continuous technological progress and development, quantum communication will play an increasingly important role in future communication fields, bringing more convenience and security to our lives and social development.\n\nWe have reason to believe that in the near future, quantum communication will become a mainstream technology in the communication field, leading us into a more secure and efficient information age.

The final content should be within a 10-minute presentation duration, with a focus on practicality and feasibility.  \nRelevant engineering practice case materials and engineering implementation experience summaries can refer to: A well-known automobile manufacturing enterprise is facing challenges such as diversified market demand, shortened production cycles, and increasing quality requirements. To address these challenges, they decided to implement an intelligent manufacturing upgrade project.  \nFirst, they introduced industrial robots and automated equipment, achieving automated production in processes such as body welding, painting, and assembly. These robots can precisely perform complex operations, not only improving production efficiency but also reducing human errors, thereby enhancing product quality.  \nNext, by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, they interconnected the equipment, components, and products on the production line. Real-time production data, including equipment operating status, production progress, and quality inspection results, are collected. By analyzing this data, the company can quickly identify issues in production and make adjustments and optimizations.  \nFurthermore, they established a digital production management system. From order management and production planning to material delivery, they realized digital control throughout the entire process. This made production plans more accurate, material delivery more timely, and effectively reduced inventory backlog and waste.  \nAfter the intelligent manufacturing upgrade, the company's production efficiency increased by 30%, product defect rate decreased by 20%, and the time to market for new products was shortened, enhancing its market competitiveness.  \n\nCase 2: Intelligent Warehousing and Logistics Management in Electronic Manufacturing  \nA large electronic manufacturing enterprise, due to the wide variety of products and complexity of components, has always faced challenges in warehousing and logistics management. To improve this situation, they implemented an intelligent manufacturing solution.  \nIn warehousing, an automated vertical warehouse was adopted. With stackers, conveyors, and other equipment, automatic storage, retrieval, and handling of goods were achieved. At the same time, a warehouse management system was used to monitor and manage inventory in real time, allowing accurate tracking of stock levels and product locations.  \nIn logistics, an intelligent logistics distribution system was introduced. By integrating with the production system, delivery plans are automatically generated based on production needs, and driverless logistics carts accurately deliver materials to the production line.  \nAdditionally, by leveraging big data and artificial intelligence, logistics data is analyzed and predicted. Material demand is forecasted in advance, logistics routes are optimized, logistics costs are reduced, and logistics efficiency is improved.  \nThrough the implementation of intelligent warehousing and logistics management, the company’s inventory turnover rate increased by 50%, logistics costs decreased by 30%, providing strong support for efficient production.  \n\nI. Summary of Implementation Experience for Intelligent Manufacturing Technology  \n1. Formulating a Clear Development Strategy: Before implementing intelligent manufacturing, companies should clearly define their development strategy, including decisions on which intelligent manufacturing technologies to adopt, which technology providers to choose, and what investments to make. A clear development strategy can effectively guide the company’s decisions and investments throughout the implementation process.  \n2. Strengthening Cooperation with External Partners: The technologies involved in intelligent manufacturing are complex, and it is difficult for companies to complete all technological development and implementation on their own. Therefore, companies should actively establish partnerships with external collaborators, leveraging their expertise and technological strength to jointly promote the implementation of intelligent manufacturing.  \n3. Adapting to the Company’s Actual Situation: When selecting intelligent manufacturing technologies and equipment, companies need to evaluate and choose based on their actual conditions. Different companies have differences in products, production processes, and organizational management, so they should not blindly follow trends. Instead, they should choose the most suitable intelligent manufacturing solution based on their actual situation.  \n4. Establishing a Comprehensive Data Management System: The implementation of intelligent manufacturing technology will inevitably generate large amounts of data, including production data, equipment data, and quality data. To fully utilize this data, companies need to establish a comprehensive data management system to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and security of the data.

The protagonist is a high school girl, and the story takes place in a school setting.\n2. The story must incorporate surreal elements.\n3. Please follow the outline format below to develop the plot:\n- Basic protagonist setup (personality traits/family background)\n- Core storyline (at least 3 main plotlines)\n- Important supporting characters (at least 3)\n- Specific design of surreal elements (must be closely tied to the story’s plot)\n- Climax and ending of the story\n4. Each section should be described in at least 500 words.\n5. Please refer to the writing style of the Japanese mystery novel \"Another,\" creating an eerie atmosphere in a school setting.\n6. The total word count should be no less than 5000 words.\nUse typical scenes and character relationships from real school life, psychological insights into teenagers, and materials on urban legends/supernatural phenomena, as well as collections of school horror stories. To understand how to set up suspenseful elements in a school setting, refer to: Xiao Gang is a first-year high school student. At this age, children should typically be lively and cheerful, blending well with their classmates. However, Xiao Gang is different. His interpersonal relationships are poor, and most of the students in his class are unwilling to talk to him, let alone play with him. The teacher has tried to communicate with Xiao Gang multiple times, but the irritable Xiao Gang refuses to listen to the teacher and even speaks disrespectfully to them. Gradually, the lonely Xiao Gang became more sensitive. He even started to physically fight with his classmates over trivial matters. Once, because a classmate from his dormitory said that he hadn't folded his quilt properly, causing the dormitory to miss out on the \"Excellent Dormitory\" award, Xiao Gang became so angry over this minor issue that he severely injured his classmate. The teacher invited Xiao Gang's parents to discuss the issue and hoped to solve Xiao Gang's problems together. Xiao Gang's mother was deeply distressed by her son's behavior and scolded him severely. Feeling helpless, Xiao Gang thought that he had been abandoned by his family, teachers, and classmates. He began to self-harm, believing that physical pain would bring him relief. This behavior frightened Xiao Gang's mother, and in a panic, she contacted our psychological health counseling center.\n\nWhen the counselor first met Xiao Gang, they noticed the numerous scars on his arms, left from his self-harm—bruises, blood clots, and old marks from sharp objects. During the session, Xiao Gang was uncooperative. He believed that everything he had done was right. His classmates ignored him, his teachers were helpless, and even his mother's scolding was because they didn't understand him or the true thoughts in his heart. Based on Xiao Gang's psychological issues, the counselor used Rational Emotive Therapy, helping him build the correct mindset, develop a sense of collective honor and responsibility, and cultivate a friendly attitude toward his classmates. After a period of treatment, Xiao Gang regained his confidence and returned to school. Through follow-up visits, we learned that Xiao Gang apologized to his classmates as soon as he returned to school. Now, their relationship has greatly improved, and Xiao Gang can communicate normally with his classmates.\n\nOfficially, the psychological development of high school students is clearly more mature than that of middle school students, reaching a higher level of development. First, their cognitive abilities continue to develop. Their perception becomes more purposeful and systematic, their observational skills greatly improve, becoming more precise and detailed; attention becomes more stable; memory shifts from mechanical memory to understanding-based memory; thinking shows a higher level of abstraction and generalization, with logical thinking taking a dominant position. Their thinking has deepened, become more independent, and more critical; imagination has also become increasingly rich and novel. The improvement in cognitive abilities provides conditions for high school students to learn complex scientific knowledge and complete heavier academic tasks. Secondly, their emotional processes develop rapidly. High school students experience emotions and feelings more intensely and passionately, with emotions more stable and deep than middle school students, tending to be introverted and differentiated. Their patriotism and collectivism are stronger, connected with a sense of social responsibility. Their sense of friendship has also increased in rationality and depth, often seeking friendship based on moral agreement and shared ideals and ambitions. Friendly expressions between boys and girls are increasing, and under proper education and guidance, they can usually control their behavior and emotions, showing moral maturity and emotional depth. Thirdly, their willpower and self-awareness improve. The level of willpower is still not very high, but their self-awareness has clearly improved compared to middle school students. Suggestibility is reduced, and their determination to overcome difficulties has strengthened. Their ability to self-regulate gradually improves, although they sometimes act out of loyalty, requiring teachers to provide timely assistance.\n\nThis story was heard later, although I experienced it myself, I have no impression of it—my mom was holding me while watching the excitement.\n\nIt was a young rural woman who had been married for less than two years and gave birth to a son. Unfortunately, she fell ill and couldn't recover, leaving the child without anyone to care for him. His aunt took him in. The aunt also had her own children, and the two kids played together without much issue. But one day, the child accidentally broke a bowl while eating. His aunt got angry and slapped him twice. The child began to cry, and that was when things went wrong.\n\nIt is said that the aunt suddenly screamed, her eyes rolled back, and she collapsed. When she stood up again, her voice and walking posture had completely changed. The familiar people immediately recognized her—it was as if she had become the dead mother of the child.\n\nSoon, the village was in an uproar, and many people gathered to watch (my mom was holding me among them). The aunt was crying and wailing inside, speaking in the tone of the child's dead mother, blaming the aunt for hitting the child. Some older relatives began to persuade her, explaining that the aunt had actually treated the child very well. After a while, the aunt stopped her commotion and started chatting with the people. Many old acquaintances came over to greet her, asking, \"Do you know who I am?\" The aunt responded, \"Of course, you are so-and-so, right? We used to make shoes together.\"\n\nSome elders were worried about trouble and advised her, saying, \"Look, everything's fine now. You should go back, and we will take good care of your child.\" The aunt agreed, \"Okay, I'll leave.\" She parted the crowd and began walking toward the village outskirts. People followed her, and as they approached the child's mother's grave, the aunt suddenly tripped and fell. Everyone helped her up, and she looked bewildered, asking, \"Why am I here? What are you all doing?\" The elders told her, \"Don't worry about us. Just promise that you will never hit the child again.\"\n\nWriting Techniques\n- Define roles and rules:  \n  Identify characters in the story, including students, teachers, and school staff, and establish some special rules or taboos related to the school. For example, \"Do not enter the old school building after 11 PM\" or \"Don't turn around in the school corridor.\"  \n  These rules can serve as the framework of the story, guiding the plot's development.\n\n- Explore hidden conditions and misleading information:  \n  Add hidden conditions or misleading information based on the rules to increase the complexity and suspense of the story.  \n  For example, the hidden condition of \"Do not make eye contact with the teacher in the classroom\" might only apply in certain situations or times.\n\n- Use breaking of rules to drive the plot:  \n  Allow characters to attempt breaking rules, using this as the driving force of the plot. However, violations of rules should have consequences to maintain the tension.\n\nCommon Elements\n- Cursed Stairs:  \n  Describe a staircase that becomes unusually terrifying at specific times or under certain conditions, such as steps that change in number or strange creatures appearing.\n\n- Red Swimming Pool:  \n  A pool that becomes dangerous at certain times (like sunset), where swimmers might be dragged into the water by an unknown force.\n\n- Old School Building's Bathroom:  \n  A bathroom that leads to another world or holds unspeakable secrets.\n\n- Ghost in the Cooking Room:  \n  A female ghost or other spirits appearing in the cooking classroom, but not necessarily very frightening.\n\n- Endless Corridor:  \n  A corridor that seems to stretch infinitely, preventing the person from ever reaching the end.\n\nStory Structure\n- Introduction:  \n  Set the background of the story, introducing the main characters and the ghostly rumors about the school.\n\n- Development:  \n  The characters gradually delve deeper into the truth behind the ghost stories, facing a series of terrifying events.\n\n- Climax:  \n  The characters are faced with life-or-death decisions and must choose how to escape the terrifying situation.\n\n- Conclusion:  \n  Reveal the true cause of the ghost story or provide a solution, giving the story a satisfying conclusion.\n\nCreating a Horrifying Atmosphere\n- Utilize environmental description:  \n  Detail the school's old and dark environment, as well as the silence and loneliness of the night.\n\n- Create suspense and tension:  \n  Use the characters' psychological activities and dialogues to convey fear, such as hesitation, anxiety, and nervousness.\n\n- Employ horror elements:  \n  Use mysterious creatures, ghosts, bloodstains, etc., but do so sparingly to avoid excessive violence or gore.\n\nExamples and Suggestions\n- Example:  \n  You could describe a student staying at school alone at night, hearing strange sounds coming from the old school building. He curiously enters and discovers that the number of stairs keeps changing, as if he can never reach the top. In despair, he sees the ghost of a girl in a school uniform, who tells him he must follow the school's rules to leave. Ultimately, he escapes the building by following the rules and bravely facing his fears.\n\n- Suggestions:  \n  In the creative process, focus on detailed descriptions and character development to make the story feel more realistic and credible. At the same time, carefully control the use of horror elements to avoid going overboard or becoming too bland.Content is blocked", "criteria": [{"name": "Plot Structure and Coherence", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how well the response follows the requested outline format and maintains logical flow between plot elements, particularly focusing on the integration of surreal elements with the main storyline.", "1-2": "Plot structure is chaotic, sections are incomplete or missing, and surreal elements are disconnected from the main story.", "3-4": "Basic structure present but with significant gaps, weak transitions between plot elements, and poorly integrated surreal aspects.", "5-6": "Follows outline format with adequate connections between elements, though some transitions feel forced or artificial.", "7-8": "Well-structured plot with smooth transitions and good integration of surreal elements, minor pacing issues.", "9-10": "Masterfully structured plot with seamless integration of all elements, perfect pacing, and organic incorporation of surreal aspects."}, {"name": "Character Development Depth", "criteria_description": "Assesses the complexity and psychological depth of character portrayals, particularly the protagonist and supporting characters, considering teenage psychology references provided.", "1-2": "Characters are one-dimensional with no psychological depth or realistic teenage representation.", "3-4": "Basic character outlines present but lacking depth, minimal use of provided psychological insights.", "5-6": "Characters show adequate depth with some psychological complexity, though not consistently maintained.", "7-8": "Well-developed characters with clear psychological motivations and realistic teenage representation.", "9-10": "Exceptionally nuanced characters with complex psychological layers and authentic teenage perspectives."}, {"name": "Atmospheric Elements", "criteria_description": "Evaluates the creation of eerie atmosphere similar to 'Another,' including effective use of school setting and integration of horror/supernatural elements.", "1-2": "No effective atmosphere building, missing or inappropriate use of horror elements.", "3-4": "Basic attempt at atmosphere but lacks consistency, horror elements feel forced or cliché.", "5-6": "Adequate atmosphere with some effective horror elements, though not consistently maintained.", "7-8": "Strong atmospheric elements with well-integrated horror aspects and effective use of setting.", "9-10": "Masterful creation of eerie atmosphere with perfectly balanced horror elements and setting utilization."}, {"name": "Technical Requirements", "criteria_description": "Measures adherence to specific technical requirements including word count, section lengths, and number of plot lines/characters.", "1-2": "Falls significantly short of requirements, missing multiple technical specifications.", "3-4": "Meets some requirements but falls short in multiple areas.", "5-6": "Meets most technical requirements with minor shortfalls.", "7-8": "Meets all technical requirements with minimal deviation.", "9-10": "Exceeds all technical requirements while maintaining quality throughout."}, {"name": "Reference Integration", "criteria_description": "Evaluates how effectively the response incorporates and utilizes the provided reference materials, including school life elements and psychological insights.", "1-2": "No meaningful integration of provided references or examples.", "3-4": "Minimal use of references, mostly superficial connections.", "5-6": "Adequate integration of some reference materials, though not consistently meaningful.", "7-8": "Strong integration of most reference materials with clear purpose and relevance.", "9-10": "Exceptional integration of all reference materials, enhancing story depth and authenticity."}]}

{"index": 1226, "domain1": "Literature & Arts", "domain2": "Game Design", "query": "**Text**  \nAn analysis of the applicability of the Renaissance The Renaissance specifically refers to the revival of classical culture that emerged in Italy between the 14th and 16th centuries and subsequently spread to most parts of Europe. It is also regarded as a historical phase of the modern age, distinct from the Middle Ages and contemporary times.  \n\nIn European languages, the historical concept of the \"Renaissance\" originates from French, and it is generally believed that the term derives from the Italian word *rinascita* (rebirth, revival). It signifies the resurgence of classical culture, represented by ancient Greece and Rome, after nearly a thousand years of decline during the Middle Ages. Initially, this term was used by Renaissance writers such as Vasari in its literal sense to describe the cultural revival of their own era, distinguishing it from the crude and unrefined previous period. In the mid-19th century, the French historian Jules Michelet was the first to use the capitalized term \"Renaissance\" in his writings to denote a modern historical phase distinct from antiquity and the Middle Ages, marked by the revival of ancient culture and a unique spiritual state. Later, Jacob Burckhardt proposed that the true driving force behind the Renaissance was \"the discovery of the world and the discovery of man,\" meaning the awakening of the human spirit. He argued that the fundamental factor of the Italian Renaissance was not merely the revival of classical culture but the emergence and development of modern consciousness, which made Italians the first modern people and led them into the modern era. As a result, the Renaissance became synonymous with an entire epoch, while the traditional Renaissance was merely one cultural component of the Italian Renaissance period.  \n\nThe term \"Renaissance\" first appeared in Chinese publications as early as 1837. In the early 20th century, Chinese scholars translated the Western term \"Renaissance\" using different expressions, such as *wenyi fuxing* (literary and artistic revival), *guxue fuxing* (revival of ancient learning), *wenyi fugu* (literary and artistic restoration), and *wenyi zaisheng* (literary and artistic rebirth). In the early 1920s, the writings of Feng Zikai, Jiang Baili, and others sparked academic interest in the concept of the Renaissance in China.  \n\nThe most distinct difference between the Renaissance and the Middle Ages lies in its emphasis on human values, which led to the rise of the so-called \"humanist\" spirit. Renaissance scholars devoted themselves to the study of rhetoric, literature, history, philosophy, and the arts. Unlike medieval scholars, who regarded \"God\" as the sole purpose and ultimate end of all activities, Renaissance thinkers were deeply interested in human value and limitations. Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) celebrated love in his numerous sonnets and recorded his thoughts and emotions while climbing mountains in his letters—his literary creations are often considered the starting point of the Renaissance. Coluccio Salutati and Leonardo Bruni used classical references to explain contemporary history and praised the politics, culture, and people of Florence. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, in *Oration on the Dignity of Man*, proclaimed the supreme status of humanity above all other beings. It is worth noting that humanism was not regarded by Renaissance scholars as contradictory to Christian faith; many sought to reconcile humanist ideals with Christianity through classical sources, such as Marsilio Ficino and Cristoforo Landino. In this intellectual climate, many members of royal courts and the Church were also strong supporters of humanism.  \n\nThe social and ideological conditions for the emergence of Renaissance art included: the struggle between monarchical and ecclesiastical power in the late Middle Ages, which led to the relative independence or autonomy of certain regions; economic prosperity in commercial cities stimulated by East-West trade; enthusiasm for and imitation of classical culture; moral and religious changes caused by factors such as plagues, wars, and explorations; and the rise of humanism. Italy was the birthplace and center of the Renaissance, and the visual arts were its most outstanding achievement. During this period, Italian culture embraced the idea that architecture, sculpture, and painting were liberal arts. Artists gained widespread social respect, with great figures like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian achieving international fame. Princes, the Church, and wealthy merchants generously patronized the arts, with the Medici family standing as a prime example of art patronage. Therefore, visual art provides a crucial perspective for understanding the Renaissance.  \n\nChronologically, the history of Italian Renaissance art can be divided into four phases:  \n1. The early stage (14th century)  \n2. The early Renaissance (15th century)  \n3. The High Renaissance (late 15th century–1527)  \n4. The late Renaissance (after 1527, also known as Mannerism)  \n\nGeographically, the Renaissance encompassed various regional styles, including those of Florence (Tuscany), Rome, Venice, Milan (Lombardy), Umbria, and Parma. Beyond Italy, countries and regions such as the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, England, Austria, and Bohemia experienced similar historical developments to varying degrees due to economic, political, and cultural influences. The Renaissance north of the Alps is collectively referred to as the \"Northern Renaissance.\"  \n\nThe ideas, techniques, and materials of Renaissance art differed significantly from those of the Middle Ages. Renaissance architecture gradually moved away from Gothic style, replacing pointed arches and clustered columns with rounded arches and classical orders that adhered more closely to ancient principles. The facades of buildings became more solemn, balanced, and proportionate, in contrast to the spires and flying buttresses of Gothic structures. Vitruvius’s *Ten Books on Architecture* was regarded as a classical reference, and ancient Roman ruins served as models for architects to study, measure, and imitate. Sculptors and painters prioritized realistic visual perception and naturalistic representation as fundamental learning methods. The tradition of creating large equestrian statues and nude sculptures was revived, and relief sculpture emphasized depth, narrative clarity, and accurate spatial perspective. To achieve the illusion of three-dimensional space on a flat surface, Leon Battista Alberti formulated the theory of linear perspective, while Leonardo da Vinci developed *sfumato*, a technique of subtle gradation of light and shadow to model form. He also dissected human bodies to gain a fundamental understanding of anatomy and physiology.  \n\nDuring the 15th century, Florentine painters produced extensive frescoes for churches, while in Northern Europe, the Van Eyck brothers pioneered the use of oil as a painting medium, leading to the development of modern oil painting techniques. Antonello da Messina introduced this technique to Italy, particularly influencing Venetian painters like the Bellini brothers. Although Florentine and Venetian schools developed distinct preferences—one favoring drawing and the other favoring color—both upheld the principle of imitating and faithfully reproducing nature. Overall, the Renaissance vastly surpassed the Middle Ages in artistic realism.  \n\nFrom its origins in the late 13th century to the late Renaissance of the 16th century, the movement underwent various transformations, culminating in Mannerism. This style, emerging around 1515–1520, became prevalent in the mid-to-late 16th century. Mannerist artists, such as Pontormo, Rosso Fiorentino, Parmigianino, Benvenuto Cellini, and Giorgio Vasari, imitated the styles of Renaissance masters like Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, but often prioritized stylization and exaggeration over the pursuit of ideal beauty. Mannerism evolved into an international style, influencing France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, Flanders, and the Netherlands. This reflects Italy’s continued artistic influence over Europe, despite its internal political, economic, religious, and cultural crises. The reaction against Mannerism led artists to explore new artistic ideals, paving the way for later artistic movements such as Eclecticism, Naturalism, and Baroque art in the late 16th century. art style in 2D side-scrolling puzzle games, along with specific design proposals.

This article will introduce a set of autumn skincare product promotion plans, aimed at providing consumers with high-quality skincare products and helping them resolve skin issues.\n\n**2. Background Analysis**  \nIn autumn, temperatures gradually drop, and the air becomes dry, easily leading to moisture loss in the skin and triggering various skin problems. Therefore, choosing the right skincare products has become a common need. Market research data shows that most people have a higher demand for moisturizing, repairing, and anti-sensitive products in autumn. Thus, when formulating the autumn skincare promotion plan, it is important to meet consumer needs and provide products that align with market trends.\n\n**3. Promotion Plan**  \n**3.1 Product Selection: Moisturizing, Repairing, and Anti-Sensitivity Products**  \nBased on market demand, we recommend promoting moisturizing, repairing, and anti-sensitivity products. Moisturizing products can help replenish the skin's moisture and enhance its moisturizing ability; repairing products can repair damaged areas of the skin and help restore skin health; anti-sensitivity products can relieve discomfort caused by sensitive skin. These three types of products have high market demand and will help drive sales growth.\n\n**3.2 Product Packaging Design**  \nIn the autumn skincare promotion plan, product packaging design can attract consumer attention. The theme colors for autumn can focus on soft, warm tones such as orange, yellow, and brown to create a warm, comfortable feel. At the same time, simple and clear fonts and graphic designs can be used to highlight product features and brand image. Additionally, the packaging should be practical and portable, making it convenient for consumers to carry and use.\n\n**3.3 Pricing Strategy**  \nWhen formulating the autumn skincare promotion plan, setting reasonable prices is crucial. The pricing strategy can be based on market research data and competitors’ prices. According to the product quality and market competition situation, appropriate discounts can be set to attract consumers' attention and increase sales volume. Furthermore, some sets or limited edition products can be launched to increase the added value and appeal of the product.\n\n**3.4 Promotion Channels**  \nIn the autumn skincare promotion plan, selecting the right promotion channels is also very important. Sales can be carried out through major e-commerce platforms, offline supermarkets, and counters. Additionally, social platforms, WeChat official accounts, etc., can be used for publicity and promotion to attract more consumers' attention and purchases. Collaborating with beauty bloggers and beauty influencers for product trials and reviews can also increase the product's exposure.\n\n**4. Necessary Measures and Expected Effects**  \nThrough the implementation of the autumn skincare promotion plan, the following effects are expected:  \n- Enhance brand awareness and reputation.  \n- Increase product sales and market share.  \n- Satisfy consumer needs and solve skin problems.  \n- Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n**5. Conclusion**  \nThe autumn skincare promotion plan is an important measure to meet consumer needs.
